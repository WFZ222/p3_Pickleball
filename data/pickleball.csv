What is the minimum space you need around the borders of the court before a fence?  Our space would be tight and we don‚Äôt want to force it and be disappointed with the gameplay.

Also, has anyone ever seen a court surface of a hard artificial turf?  Would that give the bounce needed?

Last, would it be a horrible idea to have the playing surface one material and the surface outside the lines be another as long as it was level?",1637281077

29,Pickleball,"PSA: Newer players, if you can afford a pickleball throwing machine, it will massively shorten the learning curve","Hey, guys

I'm a brand new player (hit my first ever ball last Monday) with several years of other racket sports rattling around in my brain from 25+ years ago.

I knew I was going to love this sport, so I bought a decent machine before I even took a beginner clinic last Monday.  Monday after the clinic and Tuesday, I took out the robot and hit probably 1000 balls total, mostly dinks and third shot drops, plus just enough serve returns to get them consistently deep.

Wednesday, I was immediately competitive with the intermediate crowd at the club I joined - these are 2.0 to 3.0 type folks.  

That's not to brag that I'm awesome, but to say that the ability to hit 500 specific shots in under 90 minutes is a MASSIVE advantage in learning this game.  I could not be more pleased with how well the robot works and how well the shots I drill with it translate to game situations.

The available machines are the Pickleball Tutor line from \~$800 and up ([https://pickleballtutor.com/](https://pickleballtutor.com/)), the Lobster line from \~$1000 and up ([https://www.lobstersports.com/products/products/battery-machines/pickleball.htm](https://www.lobstersports.com/products/products/battery-machines/pickleball.htm)) and the Simon line from \~$1400 and up ([https://pickleballmachine.com/](https://pickleballmachine.com/)).

Any of those should get you started but you'll definitely want the oscillation feature on any that don't have it by default.  Topspin/backspin will be necessary eventually, but maybe not essential to start out.  You don't need 2-line oscillation or a (stupidly expensive) remote.  

You turn off the machine, fill the hopper, start the machine, walk around the net and hit until empty... after setting up the drill at the beginning of the first hopper full by tweaking speed/spin/angle until it's shooting where you want, which usually takes just 10 balls or so.  

In order to make sure you're spending more time hitting balls than collecting them, the fastest ball pickup option will be a ""jumbo dustpan"" like this: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Quickie-14-in-Jumbo-Debris-Dust-Pan-49510/202523588](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Quickie-14-in-Jumbo-Debris-Dust-Pan-49510/202523588).  It works great.  Do not bother with those stupid tube collectors, and I don't see how the Kollectaball roller device could be any faster than the jumbo bin and 6 times the cost, especially most of the balls will be up against a wall where the roller will suck.

I can refill the Lobster (\~120 ball capacity) in under 5 minutes.  With a comfortable 8-second ball interval, it takes around 15 minutes to empty, so your ratio of drilling to busywork is quite high.

Happy hitting, y'all.",1636749645

48,Pickleball,Why didn't anyone tell me I should put top spin on my third shot drives?!?,"This morning while drilling with my Pickleball Tutor, I discovered for the first time that top spin is an excellent addition to third shot drives. My shots hardly ever went long and often dropped sharply after the ball passed over the net. Today I hit these shots well about 80 percent of the time -- similar to my success rate for third shot drops but much higher than my success rate for ""flat"" third shot drives (hit with no spin).

If my opponent is a step or two behind the kitchen line, he or she will have to take many of these shots from their ankles or shins. Hopefully there will be pop-ups galore!

This is all probably obvious to those of you who have tennis backgrounds, but for me it is brand new. I watch a lot of pickleball videos, but oddly this topic has not come up.

Going forward, I will be making this shot a regular part of my game.",1636578719

I am using Shea Underwood's method in which the ball is placed in between the pointer finger and middle finger in the non-serving hand (in my case, my left hand). So far my results are just OK; I am unable to get the same kick that I did with the chainsaw, but the serve is good enough that some of my rec opponents have asked me to stop using it against them. I expect to get more kick as my ability to impart spin on the ball improves (through better technique, increased finger strength, or both). 

I am able to get more kick when I spin the ball toward me than I do when I spin it away from me. This was true for the chainsaw as well. (When using the chainsaw, I used the back of my hand to spin the ball toward me.)

I practice spinning the ball every day (50 reps in both directions every morning and every night) and in rec play. In addition, I am doing exercises to increase strength in my left hand and fingers. Am curious what others are doing.",1636463671

Although it still is quite a bit of plastic being used for pickleballs I imagine. How do you reuse/repurpose pickleballs? Cause from what I've seen, most people just throw them in the trash.

28,Pickleball,How the Dink's PicklePod stacks up against other pickleball podcasts,"**Disclaimer:** PicklePod is doing a dink swag giveaway -- you write a review on the Apple Podcast site and one on social media (Facebook or Reddit) and receive a top and hat when they come out with new merch. *I think that's why you're seeing a few posts pop up in the subreddit.* I'd say I welcome the traffic, but most of the ""reviews"" have been excessively shallow. I'm going to offer my thoughts and go just a *tad* deeper (wall of text warning -- TL;DR at bottom).

I'd like to talk about the various pickleball podcasts, what they offer, and give thoughts as to why a podcast for a sport is even important.

First up, let's look at the biggest pickleball podcasts out there:

* [Pickleball Kitchen Podcast with Barrett Kincheloe](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pickleball-kitchen-podcast/id1277738056) \- 59 ratings at time of writing.
* [Pickleball Problems with Mark Renneson](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pickleball-problems/id1320946826) \- 38 ratings at time of writing.
* [Pickleball Therapy with Tony Roig](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pickleball-therapy-in2pickle/id1523311733) \- 25 ratings at time of writing.
* [Pickleball Fire with Lynn Cherry](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pickleball-fire-podcast/id1536604191) \- 29 ratings at time of writing.

I actually went on a road trip at the beginning of September, and I sampled a few of these podcasts as I've been really into the sport and generally enjoy podcasts. I had a lot of issues with these podcasts and it can mostly be summed up like this: **these podcasts feel like audio versions of YouTube instructional videos and reviews.**

It's a longer form version of instruction, formatted like a radio show. E.g. Pickleball Problems recently looked at what to do when a ball rolls onto someone's court. For a whole episode. It's probably something that could be covered in about 5 minutes, yet it was stretched into a whole episode complete with cliffhangers around the ads. I listened to the whole thing, and I have to say it was a little predictable and boring.

Also, a podcast has to be a pretty terrible format for equipment reviews. I can't say any other hobby I'm into has included reviews of physical items in a podcast as a regular thing.

The other issue with these podcasts is their demographic -- they're trying to communicate to recreational players and probably the biggest chunk of pickleball's demographics: seniors. I appreciate the sport's accessibility and love that it gets seniors moving, but social media and podcasts aimed at old folks are often different from those aimed at young folks. I'd say that the four podcasts I just pointed out are all senior-friendly, if not focused.

I think that this format of pickleball content is *okay*, but is probably better served as a blog article or a Facebook post.

That's where [PicklePod (37 ratings)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/picklepod/id1584931417) and Around the Post Show (not on Apple Podcasts) come in. PicklePod (from the Dink) is the new kid on the block. The Around the Post Show is hosted by Jonny Pickleball and Kyle Yates.

I'm gonna talk briefly about the Around the Post Show. It seems like a pretty solid bid for a pickleball show, but unfortunately it seems like they're more geared to the video format. They have a point of the week and show clips / highlights in video format. I think that as a show, it's a good idea and the hosts are well known in the pickleball world. As a podcast, listening to two people spectate a highlight and not describe what's happening? Terrible auditory experience. There's also another podcast called ""Around the Post"" which is a tennis podcast, so that's kind of funny.

Okay, this is supposed to be a PicklePod review. It's hosted by the Dink owner Thomas Shields and Tyson Apostle of Survivor fame. It's not to be confused with [the Pickle Pod by AC4SA](https://www.thepicklepod.ac4sa.com/) or this [PicklePod comedy cast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/picklepod/id1560712115) \-- I found the name overlap confusing when it was first announced, but already searching on Google seems to turn up the right thing.

As far as podcasts go, it seems that they're still figuring things out, but there are things I like more about this podcast over other ones. First up, we haven't had any talk of strategy, equipment reviews, or anything else that you'd usually find in a YouTube video.

I think if I were to describe PicklePod in a sentence, I would say it's a weekly update on professional pickleball and industry news.

In running the Dink, Thomas seems very interconnected with the industry and is kept in the loop on all sorts of happenings, both public and private. The podcast looks over and dives into news of the past week in the sport, and generates a surprising amount of conversation. They have also have had on guests and done interviews, which have been pretty entertaining, enlightening, and informative.

I found that getting into the pro scene in pickleball isn't easy. I'm new to the sport and because the PPA and APP are in competition and don't have an excellent non-streaming presence, it can be hard to understand who the top players are, what their story is, etc. Thomas and Tyson are really interested in the pro scene and discuss it, and I've picked up a lot and feel like I have a good sense of where things are.

I love the personal touch and watching them figure out the format, discussing whether they're going to get a hip-hop jingle and who will produce it. I like the joking around that they do based on their history playing some pickleball together, and I love hearing how excited both of them are in the industry's taking off and scaling.

As cool as Major League Pickleball sounded, I hadn't heard much about the specifics *except* from the PicklePod, and I'm really excited to check it out when it airs in November. Thomas also seems really involved with them and hypes up news coming with teasing hints.

As for the demographic, I feel this is one of the only podcasts that's leaning toward the pro-side of the sport. I think that the format of an hour of conversation about the sport's happenings is a good one. It's just the right length to be deep, interesting, and funny and not so much that it overstays its welcome. Because we're not talking about when to third-shot drop or whether the new One Shot paddle met the hosts' expectations, we're instead focusing on things like pickleball as a college-level sport or the unseating of Ben Johns. It's exciting stuff. Just as the Dink skews to a more social-media-savvy audience compared to a lot of pickleball media, I feel that the PicklePod does too. It's the hip podcast on the block that embraces its format for its strengths instead of trying to shoehorn the exact same content into a blog, YouTube video, and podcast. I think that the Dink media offering as a whole is very varied: The podcast covers the newsletter and makes speculations and offers opinions, the newsletter highlights items from the Dink blog and news in the sport, and the Instagram and Facebook pages focus on highlight reels and visual news.

Finally, I have to say that I enjoy the interaction with the reddit community. Thomas is very active in the subreddit and you can be sure that he reads our posts and scours here for news. Just watch the AJ Koller episode to see what I mean.

So: is PicklePod the best pickleball podcast? I can't say for sure *yet*, but it's one of the only pickleball podcasts that I've come back weekly for because I genuinely enjoy the content and don't find it stale. I'm excited to see the production quality and consistency go up. I'm excited for the hosts to get more organized over time and to get deeper chemistry, and for them to have more content to cover as the sport scales up as it's showing signs of doing!

**TL;DR:** PicklePod appeals to a younger audience than existing pickleball podcasts, and leverages its format effectively to teach you about the pro scene of the sport and get you hyped up for up-and-coming events and players. The hosts are knowledgeable, connected, and funny; and they've landed some impressive guests. It's the only pickleball podcast that I listen to every week because it doesn't rely on tips n' tricks or equipment reviews like others do.",1635110308
29,Pickleball,The Dink and PicklePod - Strongly recommend,"I've been starved for content since the Midwest weather has turned and my outdoor play has slowed to a crawl.

Can't possibly recommend the podcast enough.  Thomas Shields and Tyson Apostol from Survivor do a great job breaking down what's going on with the sport and bring a lot of personality to the podcast as well.  It's become my go to listen on my commute.  They've gotten a few big time guests like Zane Navratil as well.

37,Pickleball,Adobe on approaching the town on starting a program,"My town has zero pickleball activity, as far as I can tell.
When I moved here a few years ago, there were tape lines on a tennis court, but I never saw anyone play. I found an old local newspaper ad saying that they play at a certain time and place, but when I went at that time there was no one around. I even made a Facebook to poll the town page and got almost no response.

So long story short, I want to approach the town about starting a program, likely inside as the winter is approaching. We would need some nets, some lines and some balls, as well as some cheap wooden paddles for beginners to use. 
Has anyone here ever had to start their program? How did you approach the town and get it all started? I‚Äôm feeling very lost as to where to begin!

Thanks!",1634933023
38,Pickleball,Question about banging and lobs,"Recently I was told something about both these shots and I want to ask for your opinions to see if what I was told is valid or just someone's opinion:  


**Banging** \- I was in a rec pick up match recently where my partner and I were facing off against a pair of skilled women.  They were good PB players and very consistent with their shot placement, etc.  On 3 occasions I had a chest height return opportunity at the kitchen and I gave each a hard return (one to the side and two down the middle)  
\- I don't know if those are considered ""banging"" but one of the opponents sarcastically said ""oh, we are playing with bangers""  - Is there some kind of un-written rule about this kind of play in rec situations?  


**Lobs -** When playing against older players, is the lob shot truly frowned upon?  For context I am 49 and I was playing against a man and a women who were prob with in 10 years (older) of me.  Both good players and pretty mobile.  I hit a couple of lob shots to back them off the kitchen and my partner said that it's not cool to use the lob vs older players..   
\- the rationale was that it's dangerous for them to back pedal and risk falling which I can understand.. but if we are all playing are we not assuming certain risks or is it just better to avoid that play?",1634928581
39,Pickleball,Apologizing - I Wondering if I am alone on this one,"I have only been playing PB for about 1.5 years.  I have progressively improved as I have fallen in love with the sport.  I do not have a racquet sports background (Hockey and Lacrosse were my mains). but I hold my own with the 3.0-3.5+ crowd now.  My ""problem"" is that I am a fierce competitor and I want to win every time I play (even in rec).. not to the point where I am a Jerk about it.. but I don't like to make mistakes and cause my partner and I to lose.  


So, I find myself apologizing on the court!  Especially when Im paired up with someone who is better than me.  I'll apologize for a bad serve, an out of bounds shot, etc.  Am I the only one that does this?  I know it's a silly question.. I am just curious if anyone else finds themselves apologizing like this :)",1634924981
40,Pickleball,Would more spin in the sport make it better?,"Say there was a new paddle type available tomorrow that let you spin the ball more. Would the inclusion of this technology excite you? Would it make you want to play more? Or do you think the game is perfect and this type of addition would detract you from the game? 

I included my opinion below, but I recommend voting before reading just so it does not sway any users. 

My opinion: &gt;!I believe that spin would only make the sport better. First off it gives you more options, which helps creates deeper strategies. chop blocks and sidespin serves would become more viable. People are already topspinning the ball on dinks and rolls, so increased spin would make these shots better. I personally think slices in general aren't as harsh on the body as hitting hard flat shots. I come from a tennis background and all of the older folks I play with have very spin-focused games (rather than pace-focused). I believe it would be beneficial to older and younger folks alike. !&lt;

&gt;!Sports all have a way of constantly evolving, whether its due to new techniques, technology upgrades, stronger athletes, or rule changes. Sports are constantly changing to become more exciting for the players and viewers. Some common examples I can think of are tennis, ping pong, football, basketball, and SSBM. All of these examples have had drastic changes and evolution and most people would not even recognize their original rules or playstyles. !&lt;

&gt;!The way I see it, spin is already in the game, but it is severely handcuffed due to the rules/paddle specification. The current form of pickleball is like a restaurant that serves good pizza. They also serve chicken wings on the side (spin) but the chicken wings are cold and bland. If they are going to serve chicken wings, they should serve good chicken wings. Yes, it may change the restaurant, but the restaurant will always have good pizza, and now the customer has more options. In my mind, this would make the overall dining experience at this restaurant much better. !&lt;

&gt;!These are all my opinions and if you disagree with me that is okay. We are all allowed to have our own opinions. I would be interested to hear any counterarguments as well. Cheers! !&lt;

41,Pickleball,How Did You Fall In Love With Pickleball?,"We all have our own stories when it comes to being introduced to the sport and really getting hooked on it.  


For me, my hometown started a new club about ago during the winter months. I had no idea what pickleball was nor did I have any real experience with a racquet sport--but I was bored and in-between soccer seasons so I decided to give it a shot.  


As it turns out, we were playing on makeshift courts on a gym floor with people who were 2x, 3x, 4x+ my age. The first time I played, I sucked big time. I could barely even hit the ball! But, there were a lot of beginners with me--and a lot of friendly folks to teach me--so I decided to head back a couple days later. After I saw some pretty noticeable improvement between my two sessions, I felt really happy with myself and my growth in the sport and kept on just going until I was completely hooked.

64,Pickleball,Rubber and/or Sponge Options,"What is keeping the USAPA from allowing players to have a rubber/sponge combo (or atleast sponge) on their paddles, similar to table tennis.

Increase in Skill Ceiling: Increase in the options you have when the ball is hit to you. You can put more spin on the ball to allow for more shots around the net, more unique lobs, shorter dinks, faster drives, etc. Professionals will be able to do things that are seemingly impossible, making the sport more fun to watch. Players literally flock towards paddles that provide more spin (ex. electrum, engage pursuit), why are they intentionally limiting our options?

Silence is Golden: One of the biggest reasons HOA's and towns are hesitant to put in more pickleball courts is because the sport is inherently loud, adding sponge to the paddle surface will silence the sport making it more friendly for more locations.

Fun: More spin = more options = more creativity = more fun.

Needless to say, it's a pretty interesting take on the relationship between tennis and pickleball.  


For a TLDR of his vid, the basic ideas can be broken down to:   
1. Pickleball's growth increases competition  
2. Pickleball courts often replace tennis courts  
3. Enthusiasm for tennis in the States isn't as high as it once was  
4. Bad tennis players prefer pickleball because it is easier  


I have a lot to add to this discussion, of course, and I gotta say I disagree with a lot of the reasoning in this video. For one thing, most of it is based around the creator's personal experiences rather than hard numbers and, the numbers he does use, don't exactly tell the full story. It's true that pickleball's growth is exploding right now, but when you compare it to tennis's current numbers in the US alone, we've still got a long way to go. Pickleball is between 1/3-1/4 the size of tennis in America, is severely behind in terms of money injected into the sport, and is still establishing a wider range of exposure in both competitive and casual circles.  


Also, it's pretty easy to see why pickleball courts often replace tennis courts. They're a lot smaller for one thing, so it's a lot easier to cram them into tight spaces. Also, as the sport grows, demand is going to increase for new places to play. Because space is limited (and budgets can be tight), this invariably means some (but probably not all) pre-existing courts are going to be converted to the sport with the exploding demand. That's not really a reflection of the ""death"" of tennis, just that pb is growing quickly and new courts need to be built.  


For tennis's enthusiasm, I mean, that's more a tennis problem than a pickleball one. Pickleball's existence doesn't mean more people dislike tennis--it's more taking advantage of the fact that tennis is not quite as popular as it was a few decades ago. Looking at the numbers again, the total losses American tennis has experienced is still larger than the total pickleball player-base--so even if every single pickleball player played and left tennis, there would still be external factors not relating to pickleball that is ""killing"" tennis.  


I'm not even going to touch on the idea of pickleball being a low skill game. I'll just leave it at this: pickleball is far more accessible than tennis for most people so it's easier for the sport to stick with more folks.  


I'd also like to remind everyone that American tennis is actually coming off of a great 2020 year with the USTA reporting huge growth for the sport during the pandemic. Now, if it sticks, I don't know, but it means we can say with confidence that tennis is certainly not dead or dying as a sport. Even low estimates of the current number of players keeps tennis in a pretty comfortable spot--at least for the time being.

I use this grip because I have a huge table tennis background but I know it puts me at a disadvantage because my hand is really up the handle. I heard from multiple people that the continental grip is the best. I also tried the Selkirk Omni that has a really short handle and did not like it.  What are everyone's thoughts on which grip is the best? What are the pros and cons of different variations of how you guys hold the paddle?

My opponent returned my volley and then I fell in the the NVZ. I dodged the ball and my team mate returned it. Is the play over because I fell in the NVZ or does the point reset because the ball was returned by the opposite team? My thinking was that since he returned the ball at that point I'm allowed to go into the kitchen. Like if I volley a ball and the opponent resets I can step into the kitchen to make a dink. Another player (not involved in the game) was saying they think that it wouldn't reset until my team returns the next shot. Does anyone have some insight into this?,1634051636

10,Pickleball,How to handle targeting,"Hi

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I was in a league match and my partner and I were up 8-2 or so (first to 15). The opponents said (pretty loudly), just hit it to the guy in the blue (that was me).  Just to be clear, my question is not about whether or not that's rude or anything like that. I'm just interested how other people handle that situation strategically and mentally. By mentally, I mean I played worse because being directly called out made me a bit anxious. Strategically, anything else you can do if you know they're specifically going to keep hitting the ball to you? It worked out fine in this instance, but I definitely got super tight and didn't know if I should be changing my game at all.",1633646267

13,Pickleball,Could the pickleball sub use a self-promotion tag?,"As this is still a relatively small subreddit, it receives a lot of self-promoted content.

Self-promotion in the context of reddit is when the creator or company of a thing posts their own links, blog, or videos.

A lot of subreddits ban self-promotion, but usually only when they become so big that self-promotion is a problem. Self-promoted content is usually lower quality because an individual or entity may post *all* the content they create, while organic sharing will tend to favor only *good* content.

I've noticed that some other subreddits use a ""Self-promotion"" tag (r/virtualreality) or ""Self Content / Blog"" (r/tabletennis). Maybe this would be a decent option as banning self-promoted content might reduce some quality posts.

For some examples of good self-promotion:

- u/Tommypickleball of The Dink seems to post good content and interacts with the subreddit at a meta level.
- u/SheasCode puts a lot of effort into his videos and when they are posted they seem to generate good discussion.

There are other self-promotion accounts that just seem to post everything they upload, even though they consistently net 0 votes and no discussion.

I think the tag would at least make this stuff transparent to new users who don't recognize the usernames, and would discourage spamming and encourage natural sharing of good content.

I live in Sweden and here the sport Padel (not pickleball) have really boomed  lately, almost everyone is playing or talking about it.
A form of play that is really popular is ""Americano""

In an ordinary Americano you play together with every other attendant one time and against everyone two times.
In every game you play for a predetermined amount of point, for example 24. If you get 14 points, the other team get 10. Then you carry these points to the next round and when all games are finished the winner is the one with the most points.

Then there exists variants of the ordinary Americano, for example 

 Team Americano - where you do not change partner but you play every other team one time.

Mix Americano where you are drawn together with the opposite gender every game. And played against another man and woman until every man have played with every woman and vv.

Is this Round Robin in your world?

The reason that I ask is that I've created an app for this, called ""Americano Padel"" (on App Store and Google Play) which have become popular here and I'm thinking about creating something similar for pickleball, but if it is really the same thing then maybe I should just market the same app.",1633468756

My pain began when I had to sweep debris off the court, then played several hours. I‚Äôve been in pain for over a month - don‚Äôt want a cortisone shot, but have been icing/heating and doing some easy stretching.

Anyone have any suggestions - I really miss playing!",1632960790
47,Pickleball,Loving the pickleball community so far! Haven‚Äôt had a single bad experience yet and have only met really great people at the courts.,"I‚Äôve been going to a local park that‚Äôs got 12 courts, went for the 3rd time today and spent like 5 hours there‚Ä¶  I‚Äôve been going alone and every single time a group has asked if I wanted to join in and play doubles or swap in for a singles game while their partner sits one out. 

I‚Äôve learned more about playing and have improved more in less than a week than I have from hours and hours and hours of videos and reading about the game. 
 
Played doubles today with some random guy I‚Äôd never met against a husband/wife couple and we played for like 3 hours straight. My partner, as well as the other couple would let me know any mistakes I was making and how to correct or avoid making those mistakes again. They were super kind and pleasant the whole time and answered every single question I had (and there were lots of questions). And if I made a nice shot or did something perfectly they‚Äôd congratulate me and make me feel like I‚Äôm actively improving at the game in such a short time. 

Even when I‚Äôm sitting out and taking a break if I ask a pair or doubles game if they mind me watching them play so I can pick up some pointers they‚Äôve always said of course.  I‚Äôve only been to this park 3 times, as it‚Äôs the only place with that many permanent courts that‚Äôs a free to use public park and it‚Äôs not too far from where I live at all, and have already made like 10 new friends ranging all the way from like 17 year old kids up to senior citizens and everywhere in between. 

Everyone has been incredible and tell me not to worry about it when I tell them I‚Äôm still learning the game and they‚Äôve all taught me so much in such little time. 

I just wanted to say thanks for being an awesome community of players, coaches, spectators, and all of that good stuff!  I‚Äôve felt so much better physically and mentally now that I‚Äôm getting out and playing more and really look forward to continuing in the sport. 

I even managed to earn a nickname already from one of the older guys. ‚ÄúMargaritaville‚Äù, as I have a yellow, pink, and blue paddle with sharks and a Jimmy Buffett quote on it. (See my last posts if you‚Äôre curious‚Ä¶ haha) 

I‚Äôm really glad that my dad introduced me to the sport and am going to try to play as often as my body wants to let me. üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªü§ó

52,Pickleball,Ideas on how to structure pick-up play for competitive players,"I'd love to hear how clubs around the country are handling mixed player levels and how to keep competitive (3.5+) players happy while also making recreational play available for less competitive players?

My local club has 6-9 courts and usually one is the ""challenge court"" for 4.0+. However, we seem to have a lot of players in that 3.5-4.0 range that are dissatisfied with the level of play on the other 5-8 courts (where it is common to be paired with 3.0 or lower players). We often have all courts in use and a handful of players waiting a turn. I want to put in a proposal to have 3 courts set aside for competitive play but need to figure out the best system to use on those three courts.

My brother plays in a competitive private group and their system is each court plays 3 games (you partner with each person on the court) and the top two after all three games move on to the next court. This doesn't work with people waiting though. I've also heard of clubs that do times - all courts play for 10 minutes and whoever's ahead moves to the next court and splits up. What else are clubs doing?",1632872413

72,Pickleball,I was disappointed with my first (and the club's first) Pickleball event. Were my expectations too high?,"**Background:**  I have been taking lessons with this relatively new club.  Although they offer many lessons throughout the week, there is relatively very little time for recreational matches.

**Expectations:**  I was hoping to play a ton of games against a variety of other doubles.

**The Event:**

* It was advertised as a ""Round Robin"" that would focus on being social with only a bit of competition.
* All matches were doubles, but the advertisement didn't stipulate whether or not they had to be mixed.
* Players without partners were assured a partner would be found for them.  *Evidently, this was not as trivial as the advert made out, and at least a few people were frustrated.*
* The advertisement said it maxed out at 32 players, so register soon.  *There were 50 people there.*
* There was enough space for 8 courts.  *They only opened 6.* 
* The event was advertised to run for 4 hours if there were enough people.  *People were leaving at three hours because they were no longer being assigned matches.*
* Matches were a single game to 15.  *My first match didn't start until a hour in.*
* Dinner was included.  *Grocery store sausages/hamburgers grilled by the organizer on a single charcoal grill, Caeser salad, and some chips.* 
* Teams were organized into 3 broad groups of skill levels, and played only within their group.  *For some reason, this caused multiple courts to be vacant for up to 10-15 minutes at a time.*
* *Each team, including mine, played 3 matches.  At least some played only 2, including a friend of mine.*
* The event was **$60.00/person.**

***In regards to price and what was offered, is this a typical pickleball event?***

Because at three hours in, when I was told my third match was my last one, I was quite angry.  There was supposed to be an hour left.  The consolation was that there were still some matches finishing up and a bunch of empty courts, so my partner and I begged some players who hadn't left yet to play with us.  We found a couple of friendly players and played three more games in the last 45 minutes.  These were totally ""off the book,"" and yet the most fun I had all day.",1632684297

I probably will just get the Standard weight, but I was curious as to how the LITE weight differs. Does anyone have experience trying out both the Standard and Lite weight 6.0 paddles?

81,Pickleball,Rally Scoring leading to more Aggressive Serving?,"I'm fairly new to Pickleball but I've been thinking a lot about the potential move to rally scoring and what that might do to the serving aspect of the game. One of the best arguments against moving to rally scoring I've seen is that there's a balance in advantage in the current system: the server gets the advantage of being able to score a point, while the defending team- more or less- gets the advantage of starting the rally at the NVZ.

The chainsaw serve aside, it seems like most higher level players serve quite safely, as the chance to score points is too valuable to squander when most defending players at the upper levels can get a serve back no matter what. I'm wondering if a move to rally scoring means that serving aggressively becomes more popular- chainsaw outlawed or no. The receiving team will always have the advantage of having at least one member at the NVZ. With rally scoring the receiving team also now has the advantage of scoring. So losing the serve isn't anywhere near as detrimental.

Meanwhile the serving team only has one advantage left- the ability to control the first hit of the rally. Serving safely cedes control to your opponent, allowing them to get to the NVZ comfortably where probability of winning the point is in their favor. Serving more aggressively, the server increases the chance at denying the receiver the ability to hit a comfortable return and get to the NVZ, increasing the serving teams own chances at getting to the line if the return is poor. If the server faults, the server gets the advantages of receiving.

I don't think we'd be seeing tons of aces or anything like that, but I'm wondering if harder serves and/or serves with more spin around the edges of the box become far more common across all levels of play- as the risk would be far more worth it. Hoping this doesn't become another debate on whether or not moving to rally is right for pickleball. But I am interested in hearing others thoughts on what *might* happen to the games current meta under rally scoring, particularly in regard to serving.

TLDR: How would a move to rally scoring affect serving aggression in pickleball?",1632408433

86,Pickleball,Fencing Between Sidelines,"Back again with more research for our courts. One highly debated topic is fencing and gates. There seems to be two thoughts on fencing. One is fencing between sidelines of courts, and the other is no fencing between sidelines. Personally I think no sideline fencing looks nicer, makes the complex seem more open, larger, and inviting as we know Pickleball is a social sport. Then for gates, there‚Äôs a few people who want to extend baseline and sideline fencing to the exterior fencing and add gates. So to get to any court, you have to walk through a gate. No opening. They say a 6‚Äô opening from sideline/baseline fence to exterior fence will just allow a lot of balls to pass through instead of just being stopped at the fence. I feel like with sideline fencing it encloses it too much and doesn‚Äôt look as nice. I also don‚Äôt think balls passing through are as big of a problem as is described by others.

97,Pickleball,Spin Serve Polling ‚Äì Pros vs. Reddit Amateurs,"First, I want to thank the 300 people who took the time to respond to my spin serve poll question. The large number of responses underlines the fact that the hand-generated spin serve controversy has provoked strong feelings and a lot of interest.  Here's a percentage breakdown of the responses:

Q: What type of hand-generated spin serves should be legal, if any?

OPTION                                                                       VOTES                PCT

Ban all hand-generated spins                                      119                  40

Continue to allow all hand-generated spins               58                  19

Ban spinning off paddle only                                         44                  15

Allow spinning with non-paddle hand only                 80                  27

Total:                                                                                  301

The most popular option was to ban all hand-generated spins, and yet 3 in 5 respondents favored at least allowing spinning with the non-paddle hand.  A little under 1 in 5 were okay with allowing any kind of hand-generated spin.  There was almost an even split between those favoring a ban on all hand-generated spins and those okay with spins using paddle hand and/or non-paddle hand ‚Äì 40 vs. 42%.

It's interesting to compare these responses to those from Zane Navratil's recent study, which was featured on ""The Dink"" online pickleball newsletter.  Zane sent out a survey to the top 25 singles and top 50 doubles players of both genders, and received 51 responses.  On the ""what should be legal or illegal"" questions, here's the breakdown (in percentages).  I've included the corresponding results from the Reddit survey, which one can infer by grouping various responses.

\-------- PROS ----------                      ------ REDDIT -------

OPTION                                           ALLOW             BAN                    ALLOW            BAN

Paddle Toss                                         10                    90                           19                 81

Paddle Hand Toss                               35                   65                           34                 66

Non-Paddle Hand Toss                      63                   37                           60                 40

So in conclusion, and assuming these sentiments are reflective of those held by the pickleball community at large, a heavy (4 to 1 or better) majority of both pros and amateurs favor outlawing spinning the ball off the paddle when serving, while roughly a 2 to 1 majority would also ban Zane's chainsaw (off the paddle hand) serve as well.  At the same time, roughly a 3 to 2 majority favors continuing to allow the Morgan Evans style ball toss hand spin.

To what degree these views will be reflected in the 2022 rule changes is anybody's guess, but given the amount of controversy and the degree to which hand-generated spin serves has affected the game, it's hard to imagine that the rules committee will not attempt to address the issue in some way.  To my mind the odds favor an outright ban on imparting any spins using the paddle hand, with the only real question being whether the Morgan style non-paddle hand spin will still be allowed.",1632239958

13,Pickleball,Diversify your game to get better,"My wife and I started playing pickleball in the beginning of July. We were preparing for our annual Independence Day party at our home, and bought one of the Franklin half court beginner nets to play in the driveway. It was a huge hit. And we fell in love with the game. We try to play on our mini-court whenever we have a spare half an hour. We have also discovered our favorite local outdoor courts.

Here‚Äôs the thing though, We have only ever played singles against each other. And we deluded ourselves into thinking we were developing okay.

That all came to an end this week. With the kids back in school full time, we decided to check out morning open play at our local indoor facility. What a huge eye opener it has been in 2 days of playing!

We are the youngest people in the facility by far, and we are getting our butts handed to us. It‚Äôs our first time playing doubles and playing against other people. We have encountered nothing but kindness and warm welcomes, and this has invigorated us to keep showing up.

So my advice to all of you is, Diversify who you are playing against. Get into local rec play, and league play, and don‚Äôt be afraid to try a tournament. Playing against all these different styles and abilities is only going to push us to be better. And it will make you better too!",1631900565

31,Pickleball,Some questions about chainsaw serve execution,"After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6_SJblL6us), I have a few questions.

1. For those of you who use the serving hand to impart spin on the ball, **do you find that you get greater kick when spinning the ball off the** ***front*** **or the** ***back*** **of the hand?** The PikNinja guy said it's harder to get high RPMs off the back of the hand, but this is not the case for me.
2. **Should the direction of the chainsaw spin always be completely parallel to the baseline?** Alternatively, would it sometime be advantageous to impart spin in some other direction? Has anyone tried using diagonal spin? I have found that occasionally imparting forward spin can cause my opponent to return the ball long. I have had good success with chainsaw-delivered short serves, and I wonder if these would be even better if I used the chainsaw to impart a combination of sidespin and backspin.
3. **When deploying the chainsaw serve, does it make sense to hit the ball hard or soft?** The PikNinja guy said you can get greater kick with a softer serve, but I have not found this to be the case. Moreover, a softer serve presumably would give the opponent more time to react to the kick. I seem to get my best results with low, hard serves.",1631635748

Naturally, this leads me to look at paddles with 4.5"" grips - however this somewhat limits my shopping options - I guess my question is, is it easy to re-grip or over-grip a smaller-gripped paddle to build up the handle in a way that will result in a nice, solid feel?

62,Pickleball,"Best way to learn, coming from competitive table tennis?","I showed up to a meetup. There was a lot of people and few courts. Us beginners were taught to serve and serve return and to dink, and right away they wanted us to play doubles, get off the court, wait our next turn to play doubles. This is very different than how I learned table tennis, where you can rally one on one and get lots of strokes in first before ever playing a singles match, much less doubles which comes much later as doubles is way harder.

First question, how do I go about learning this sport, especially cause I feel like I need to get some practice with people a little better than me where I can get a lot of strokes in rather than worry about ""winning.""

The paddle is very different because it's hard, unlike table tennis which uses a rubber and sponge making the paddle very soft and grippy. I inadvertently try to hit the ball at an angle (a mix between of brushing over the ball and hitting it) and there's no grip with the pickle ball paddle so the ball goes low. Also, there's so much feedback coming in from the paddle. I have super sensitive feel from table tennis, the feel from the paddle is just jarring. Are there any paddles that could reduce the feel? Also, are there paddles that have more grip on the ball? In table tennis, paddles are made of layers and the the more wood layers in a paddle, the more feel there is, while the grip is determined by the toposheet. The PB paddle I played with was a $200 paddle, so it probably wasn't wood, but the feel was way way too much for me.",1631145466

Let's say we have four players: Al and Ann (team 1) and Bob and Barb (team 2). Does server 1 and 2 assignments stick to specific players throughout a game or not? In other words, if Al is Server 1 initially, will he remain server 1 for the rest of the game, or is Server 1 simply based on who is in the Right court when a fault happens by the other team?

Are ALL serves after a fault from the OTHER team always taken from the right side?

If Al is Server 1 and he serves from the right side and his team faults, then does Ann serve from the Left side?

If my waist is moving up at the same time as well...is it a moving target? Or the waist line at beginning of motion or waist line at normal standing position?

75,Pickleball,Getting along with less/more experienced players - and having a blast!,"This seems to be a highly relevant topic to the sub.  

It's really important to bust the myth that you cannot have massive amounts of fun when playing with a less experienced and capable player.  

Coach Simone and coach Phil bust this myth right here  - you \*can\* get better when playing with less experienced players - they do it!: [https://youtu.be/Qzgd1zaePVk](https://youtu.be/Qzgd1zaePVk)

TL;DR of that one - playing with a less experienced player - accommodate their needs - work on precision, work on form, and work on associating with people - the joy you give them will come back to you in the great feeling you have in your game, new friends, a satisfied mind in life, and you can still become the best in the world while doing that - all the time.

The bigger point, that they don't explicitly cover is that this is the way people mature in their self-development through sports - as you advance, if you can learn to accommodate and associate with players that are both more and less advanced, and find ways to improve and have fun, then you have matured as a person.  If you can't do that, then some of the bigger lessons to be found sportsmanship will simply remain beyond your reach, and, no matter how hard you can bang, your development is far from advanced.

Yeah, you can accommodate that player, without working on your overhead smash, and you can challenge yourself just as much while you do it.

We been run out of a YMCA because we were new (to the Y, not to the sport) and they didn't want new people interloping.  A couple of guys decided to whale on us just to get their point across... and it was clear it was done on purpose. 

We went to an outdoor club where the women we were playing found my serve hard to return, so they just let me serve it out and didn't even try to be competitive (and they were good players, too) and it was just bad sportsmanship. 

We also play at an outdoor public court and usually play at the same time as another group who insists on playing music. I finally asked the guy very politely if they minded turning it down a little and was met with a defensive refusal. I told him he was being rude. 

After reading the discrimination thread and other people's stories there, it seems like the polite, friendly nature of the sport has taken a dive. Has anyone else experienced this?",1630872554

For my best trait, it would be a split between my athleticism/ability to make extremely difficult shots and my serve (nonchainsaw) which sets my points up super nicely.  


Conversely, my worst traits are probably my inconsistencies at the NVZ. I'm often either popping my dinks up too high and getting sped up or hitting them just barely into the tape.

90,Pickleball,There's nothing wrong with the ZaneSaw/Spin serve. Change my mind.,"I am not convinced that the spin serve is bad for the game and should be banned.

The game is being innovated by top-level players. It's evolving. This is **great** for the sport. Yes, the serve is difficult to defend against, but it's also difficult to deliver *consistently*. Soon, maybe a few years or maybe less, it will become more common both to utilize and to counter. 

By making a rule banning the spin serve would be harmful to the sport, as it is a rule preventing an innovative play style. The game will become stale if no new strategies or forms can be found, let alone are prevented.

Some people say that it now gives a huge advantage to the serving side when the returning side should have the advantage since they cannot score. I can see how this *could* be an issue, but the serving side has **one** chance per point to execute it. If the defenders can return the serve they are now at the obvious advantage. 

If you disagree, post in the comments! I want to see this sport grow and if it *truly* is bad for the sport and can prevent positive growth, why?",1630619468

Both opponents figured we were going to call the serve ‚ÄúOUT‚Äù so they were slow to react and didnt get to the ball.

* Removing the original grip and layering on specific grips to keep the feel of the ridges

I keep experimenting with heavier and heavier paddles; I'm up to an 8.7 oz paddle and still feeling like I could use more so I found the lead tape comment interesting.  I just love the stability of a heavy paddle so I may try adding weight there.

I also double grip my paddle and I noticed the ridges aren't as distinctive with the second grip, so I may have to give his de-grip re-grip method a try.

5,Pickleball,"Obligatory ""I love pickleball"" post","Moved to Denver a couple months ago.  Grew up playing tennis competitively in high school.  Drove past the parks and saw that the pickleball courts were absolutely packed.

Ordered a racket from Amazon last Friday and it got here the next day on Saturday.  I've played every day since for at least 2 hours each day.  I'm straight up in love (or addicted) to pickleball.  There's no other sport like it where you just show up, you know others will be there, and you know it'll be competitive.  It's just so much fun and good vibes all around.  People sharing balls, sliding courts for the next group, putting your racket in the fence for next game, young &amp; old, girls &amp; guys, it's just very refreshing.  

There's also something very humbling (and frustrating) about losing to two 60 year old men when you're in your 20s.  Gotta keep it up till I can out dink those guys.  

Few things I've learned so far:

* You don't need to stand at the baseline for return of serve or your 3rd shot.  You don't want to be moving backwards when hitting a deep ball, so it's better to stay a few feet behind the baseline instead.
* You need a top spin dink on both sides.  Too many dead dinks otherwise.
* Go down the middle more when everyone is at the kitchen.  Force them to decide who takes what.
* Don't need to and shouldn't take the racket all the way back, keep it in front of you.  And don't need to ""hit"" the ball.  You can guide it over by doing a smooth swing without any acceleration or deceleration.  Just a smooth pace and motion.
* More volley dinks in general

I welcome all other tips!  Especially how to hit a 3rd shot dink off a heavy backspin 2nd shot.",1630521454
6,Pickleball,Alternative/Similiar paddle to the Electrum Pro,"First off, I love this paddle.  I previously was using a Z5 (not graphite), and in comparison, the z5 is a heavy brick.  I don't think I could go back to such a heavy paddle.  I get a lot of enjoyment from spinning the ball.

The problem is that the Electrum just doesn't seem very sturdy.  The rubber surrounding the paddle came loose almost immediately which isn't a huge deal, but the paddle now has a bit of a rattle to it when not hit perfectly.  


I still love it, and to their credit, Electrum is going to replace it.   I may just buy another so I don't have a 3 week downtime while I'm waiting for the warranty to process.....

He just sent out a draft of his initial presentation and he does a great job of presenting the statistics that clearly show that Morgan Evans has the most effective (most missed returns) serve, but that the effectiveness of all ""spin serves"" is declining as people see them and play against them more. The hope is to point out to the rules comitee that the proposed rule change they are considdering ""Banning the use of the paddle AND the paddle hand in tossing or adding spin to the ball"" (not ver-batem, just my understanding) would outlaw Zane and Ben's serves, but let Morgan continue dominating with his significantly more effective spin serve.

One of the beginner videos I watched this weekend stressed the importance of court shoes. Of course, a specific brand was recommended, so I took his advice with a grain of salt. I've been rotating two pairs of sneaks made for trail running, which I also wear when hiking and biking.

If dedicated court shoes won't make much of a difference, are there any grip sprays I should consider?

A match consists of the best of 3 games each to 21 points.
The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.
Tied at 20, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.
Tied at 29, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.

Note: This can easily be tweaked, e.g. best of 3 or 5 games each to 11 points‚Äù

While pickleball is marketed as a sport for ""all ages,"" age discrimination still exists against the younger generations attempting to play, restricting access to courts and facilities.

I chose to write on this topic because I am a young person, playing now for 4.5 years and whenever I go to play at a new court or facility, if I don't quickly establish my 4.0+ rating people assume my skill is low due to my age and I am constantly coached. It doesn't help that I look to be about 20 or 21. I am wondering if anyone has similar experiences, or if they can point me in the direction of sources I can use to back up my claim. I am also frustrated in not being able to participate in 50+ or 55+ facilities or court time, as well as limited in tournaments. For example at Canadian Nationals there were only 8 teams in the mens 17-35 whereas there were upwards of 20+ in other categories.

89,Pickleball,Do most higher level players use thicker core paddles and is there benefit?,"I noticed that most better players I see on the courts and online tend to play with the more modern, thicker style paddles. Is there generally an advantage/appeal to that style? The only exception I see to that are from Pro Kennex and some Head paddles, such as my own that is only 10mm thick.


I tend to be a creature of habit, and I'd rather not get set in a particular style paddle if the industry is moving away from it or I'm giving something up. I started playing a little over two months ago, but due to being laid off, I've been playing 4-5 days a week and improving quickly, playing at around a 3.5 level now. 

First serious paddle I played with was the Head Extreme Tour, as it was recommended to me as more of a control paddle since I'm fairly strong and power isn't an issue. Firm face and thin core (10mm). At first I liked that it seemed like there was less variability on the face and ""sweetspot difference"", but I'm starting to suspect that it may just be less feedback. First paddle I played with was the Niupipo Explorer. I didn't necessarily like the feel at the time and it felt like their was variability in the power, but this may have very likely just been due to me being new and not having a feel for the game compared to other paddle/racquet sports.

The rulebook is relatively short and easy to read. It also contains clickable links in the table of contents, so you can quickly just go to the contents, click on a topic (there's really only seven or eight topics that are relevant for most people), and quickly find the answer to whatever you want to know about a rule.

If you're playing in tournaments or even just playing in club rec play, you owe it to yourself and your fellow players to be familiar with the rulebook :) Not only is it to your benefit to know the rule, but it also will help to head off any uncomfortable or awkward interactions with other players.

May I have quick questions about the serve:

1. I saw a video saying that when serving we could drop the ball to ground and hit the ball when it bounces up, is that true ? Moreover, with that way, the paddle can be above the waist and the wrist, correct ?
2. Regarding the **change** of service, do we always start the serve on the right side (the even zone) ? Or it depends on the score, i.e. if his/her score (not the total) is odd, we serve on the odd zone ? Strictly on the **side** of serve rule, is there a difference between playing single and double ?
3. If the ball hits the net and falls into the correct zone after the serve, can the opponent keep playing it or it must be replayed ?

Now that we have finished the first half of 2021, it seems like a good idea to reach out to our membership to share some of the developments that have taken place and what we can look forward to in the coming months.

To say it has been an eventful 6 months would be an understatement. As the pickleball community began to emerge from the 2020 Covid-19 shutdown, the sport has rebounded tremendously in terms of participation and popularity. From a USA Pickleball perspective, our membership dropped a bit in 2020 due to the pandemic, from 40,000 the previous year to 37,000. This year, however, membership has skyrocketed to over 48,000 and continues to climb. Some of the programs we have put in place to help support our membership include:
 
A new membership program providing a welcome kit with a decal, window cling, bag tag and multiple partner offers was introduced on June 1. Annual dues increased from $20 to $35 ($95 for 3 years and $150 for 5 years) which can easily be offset by discount offers from Hotel Planner ($25 voucher), Acacia Sports (20% discount on shoes) and Franklin (free 3-ball pack for new members or 30% discount on Franklin merchandise for renewing members).
The enhanced Official Club Membership was rolled out offering participating clubs insurance coverage and other benefits for recreational players.
Our new online shop (shopusapickleball.com) was launched with all new apparel and accessories.
The inaugural National Indoor Championships, originally scheduled for 2020, took place in Hoover, Alabama this June with over 750 players competing. Feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive.
The USA Pickleball National Championship Series was announced, and the first tournament, the USA Pickleball Newport Beach Championships, was a success. The series also includes the Jigsaw Health Tournament of Champions (August), the APP Atlanta Metro Open (September) and the APP Hilton Head Open (October) leading up to the USA Pickleball National Championships this December in Indian Wells. Tournaments in the series are qualifiers for the Nationals and will carry a combined 125 hours of streaming coverage on ESPN+ and For the Fan.

Regarding the Nationals, the year thus far has had its ups and downs. While we are excited the Nationals will be back after last year‚Äôs cancellation, the event was pushed back from November to early December due to scheduling conflicts at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden which disrupted some of the travel plans participants had already made. In addition, the Indian Wells Tennis Garden recently announced that anyone attending any event, not just our tournament, at their facility needs to show proof of having received the Covid-19 vaccination. This applies to anyone entering their property - players, fans, vendors, sponsors, staff, volunteers and so on. We were disappointed by the decision but respect their right to implement the policy, even though we know it has upset many players, some of whom will choose not to participate.

Looking forward to the rest of this year, a lot of focus will be on the National Championship Series and the Nationals while also setting the tournament schedule for next year. We hope to announce the 2022 schedule for the Regional Championships, National Indoor Championships and National Championship Series, including the qualifying process for the Nationals, in the next few weeks.

We have also put together a team to take a hard look at our UTPR ratings system. We have heard the feedback from our members and are evaluating options for upgrading UTPR to address the issues. There are a lot of positives about UTPR, but it is not perfect (nor is any rating system!). We are committed to making improvements over the next several months in time to be implemented in early 2022.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I plan to keep you updated from time to time when there is news to share. We truly appreciate your membership and hope you enjoy the rest of your summer.

Also the constant lobs from Matt Wright was hilarious.",1628593683
30,Pickleball,Opinion on Tournament Placement,"My good friend and I started playing Pickleball about a year ago (absolutely love it). We‚Äôve done 3 tournaments together- and have struggled each time. We feel that individually we‚Äôre 3.5 level players (at our local club we often play and keep up with 3.5 and even some 4.0 level players)- but each tournament we‚Äôve been in- we‚Äôve signed up for 3.0 and have had a losing record, each time. What is frustrating is we don‚Äôt feel the competition is too hard- we just make so many easy mistakes and get in our own heads (and often blow leads).

I‚Äôve heard a lot of people complaining about people who ‚Äúsandbag‚Äù down to lower levels, at tournaments; and any time we tell friends from our Pickleball club that we‚Äôre playing 3.0 in the upcoming tournament- we get weird looks and have even had some people remark that we shouldn‚Äôt be playing that low (with a don‚Äôt sandbag remark, here and there).

So my question is if you were in our shoes- would you keep playing 3.0- since we‚Äôve struggled mentally at the tournaments and lack confidence? Or would you go up to 3.5 since physically we can keep up and it would be the best ways to challenge ourselves and improve? Appreciate any thoughts or advice! I can say I personally would rather move up and try to challenge ourselves more- as I tend to play to my competitions level. But my partner is hesitant- and thinks we should stay in 3.0 until we can prove we can win consistently at the level.

TL;DR- Semi-new players are conflicted on which skill division to play in tournaments.",1628581117

38,Pickleball,Let's Talk Paddle Prices,"So, we all know Selkirk made waves when they released their Vanguards at $200 flat. That made me wonder what we all, as a community of players, think paddles should generally cost. In other words, how much you're willing to spring for a new paddle.  


Personally, I've been rocking with a Rally Tyro 2 Pro for about a year (I bought a pair for about 50 bucks each at a slight discount). I can't say I've had much issues with their performance--though I have noticed some annoying wear and it seems some issues are starting to appear.  


Maybe it's because I'm younger and have less readily available disposable income (the life of a poor college kid amirite) but the highest I could reasonably see myself spending on a paddle is maybe $100. I love Selkirk and other high-end brands. Their products are great. But, there just isn't enough of a clear advantage to justify $150-$200+ for me. These products are important, but at the end of the day almost any game of pickleball will be won or lost by the player, not the paddle.  


I'd love to know others' thoughts on this, though. What paddle\[s\] do you use? What price point are you willing to go to? Where do you think the market should generally sit?",1628448296

A few weeks before I had the cramp I sweated profusely during play and was sure to drink adequate water (plain water).  I eat a relatively low salt diet due to high blood pressure.  To treat the cramp in my left calf I used heat, rolled it, massaged it and ensured hydrating properly.  It was so bad I scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic doctor. After a week or so my wife suggested that maybe I needed to replenish my electrolytes.  I did some research and learned that the main electrolytes are magnesium, potassium and chloride.  Aha.... chloride comes from salt (sodium chloride).  So I drank my wife's electrolyte drink (mixed with water) and my cramp has slowly gotten better.  Even played today for the first time in 2 weeks.   Just curious if others have had the same problem and what you use?  Someone recommended Lo Salt.",1628217292

48,Pickleball,Confused About Serve Order,"During covid some neighbors and I have been playing pickleball and we love it. 

One area where we keep getting confused is on who serves and in what order. 

So I get the start is easy. 0-0-2 you start from the right. If you get a point you move the other side and continue until you fault. 

Then the other team gets the ball and let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs it‚Äôs now 0-1-1

The opposition is serving from the right on their side. If the opposition faults. It‚Äôs now 0-1-2

Q1) do you served from the right again as it‚Äôs still an even score or so you serve from the left side. As your partner who faulted started on the right?

Let assume they fault again and it‚Äôs now 1-0-1 and you get the ball back. 

Q2) Do you start from the right as you get the serve back or from the left as it‚Äôs an odd score

Q3) who severs? can the person who started the game as the ‚Äú2‚Äù @ 0-0-2 start again as the ‚Äú1‚Äù or should it be the partner as they in theory were the ‚Äú1‚Äù @ 0-0-2

Q4) should you stick as a ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú2‚Äù through the game or does it depend something else or it can be totally random.",1628207997

I love watching the guys over at PrimeTime Pickleball, Pickleball Kitchen, Pickleball Pirates, etc telling me how to improve or up my game and so on. Moreover, good pro play is very entertaining in its own too. So, don't get me wrong, all that is great. However, it gets *so stale*. It seems like there is very little variation in the style of content we see.  


Recently I came across Shea Underwood's channel and I think it's a nice kind of break. I like his editing style and his content is a bit more varied. He does the tutorial/breakdown stuff, raw gameplay (usually edited down), and some shorts stuff.  


I just wish there were some other creators out there who would do more with the game. Story type videos, pro-play coverage, fun pickleball challenges, or some other form of unique content.   


One of my favorite content creators as of late has been Cult Tennis. He covers the pro-tennis scene with interesting, well-made, in-depth, and enthralling videos that tell engaging stories and break down high level play in a more interesting manner than the norm.

I‚Äôm just wondering how is it that people want to put more restrictions on serves, when enforcement of rules on just a basic serve is already so messed up. I‚Äôve played a few tournaments now, and the amount of times I‚Äôve seen people do blatant illegal serves (e.g. a clear high to low motion) is too much. 

Even in the pros. There was a match between Ben Johns and Gabriel Joseph.

86,Pickleball,Modifications on Gameplay for Practice,"I love pickleball, and think it's a great sport. Although, one thing I find is that it can be a get to be a bit one sided. Especially when you have a lower level team against a more advanced team. Often times the lower team gets overwhelmed and the game becomes a bit of a mess for them. My friends and I came up with a way that makes it a little easier for lower level players to compete with more advanced players. We only do this for practice sometimes. Usually we're playing the normal way. But I thought that it works well, and people seem to enjoy it, so just wanted to share in case others want to try it.

Here are the modifications: 

1. If serves are out/short, they can be redone until they're in. So, people can practice their serves without any pressure. 

2. If return of serve is out or hits the net. Then the server serves again. Same logic as before. Trying to let people practice their returns without pressure.

3. If a side scores two points in a row, then a ""side-out"" occurs and the other team serves. This prevents sides from building a lot of momentum, and gives a weaker team a chance to practice their serving more.",1627582261
87,Pickleball,Can anyone share their experiences with trying out rally scoring?,We often have games on courts where after both games end we switch up who is playing where. Rally scoring (see https://pickleballnews.com/rally/ for a detailed explanation) where a team gets a point if they win the rally (not only if serving) would allow the games to end closer to the same time. I also like rally scoring from other sports and think it is easier. Anyone have experience trying to implement it? Or have reasons why it is a bad idea for pickleball.,1627580351

We have tried a system where the winning pair of a game move to the  left and the losing pair moves to the right (winners on left most court stay). Each pair then splits up to play the next game. This works fairly well, but you almost never wind up with the four best players on one court.

So since the opponent didn‚Äôt return it, does it count for me or the opponent? 


So I think it could be argued that since it did bounce in the opponents zone, and they didn‚Äôt return it, it could be interpreted like going out of bounds after bouncing in the play area.

5,Pickleball,Best way to increase UTPR rating,"Obviously, beat people higher rated.

I'm relatively new to all of this. I've played in 3 sanctioned tournaments, and won Gold in 3.0 Men's Doubles in the first 2 and Bronze in 3.5 Men's Doubles in the most recent one. I also won Gold in Men's Singles 3.0 in 2nd tournament (after not placing in top 3 in first tournament in this division).

Here's my dilemma - after getting Bronze in Men's 3.5 recently, my score actually went down slightly from 3.41 to 3.35! 

What should I do...keep playing 3.5 division until I'm winning it consistently? Or move up to 4.0 where I'll have a better chance of beating someone who has a much higher rating than me?

My goal isn't to win medals but to increase my UTPR rating.

Thanks!",1627397904
6,Pickleball,Advice Needed - Getting Out Of Your Head,"Hey y'all. I hope you're having a great day. Coming here because I need some help with my own inner thoughts while on the court. I usually do great at the beginning of my matches (I play singles) and take a wide lead. But when I get to a score of 7 or 8, I just lose it for some reason. I'm not concentrating like I should and become very sloppy, which allows my opponent to catch up and eventually overtake me. Any suggestions to get out of a late-match funk would be appreciated.

11,Pickleball,Public courts,"I‚Äôm new-ish to the sport and would love some perspective. I often play as part of a foursome at public courts. There is no city moderation at all. Typically we arrive first thing in the morning before other players.  There is a local ‚Äúpickleball club‚Äù that meets up at the same courts about 30-45 minutes after we arrive and they play rotations. Often 30 or more people show up from their club. They do not rent the courts in any way. 

What has been happening lately is that they want us to join their rotation. When my group is there, we‚Äôre playing a match - our intent is not to rotate. But they want access to the court that we‚Äôre on. 

This morning, my group was finishing our last game. When we began the game, not all courts in the complex were full. It was a very close game, and at 7-9 a leader of the pickleball club came on court, stopped our play, and informed us that members of the club were upset that we were on court too long and that we needed to rotate! We told him that we were nearly finished and that we would be headed out after this game (not that we should have to! Public courts). After about 5 minutes, another man stopped our play. He identified himself as the club ‚Äúambassador‚Äù and tried to tell us that Pickleball etiquette suggests that we need to rotate is the courts are full and others are waiting. Again - they were NOT full at the start of the game. And they did NOT have the courts reserved (I did ask him, as they city does offer this). I shared with this person that we were nearly finished and he persisted. 

My question. Am I missing something here? Is there etiquette that I don‚Äôt understand for public courts that have NO open play guidelines? Was it unreasonable to expect to get to finish our game? 

Thanks for your guidance!",1627243551

37,Pickleball,Would you use the chainsaw serve if it resulted in an Ace 20 percent of the time but also went out 20 percent of the time?,"I videotaped a recent tournament 3.5 mixed doubles game. Upon reviewing the video, I documented that serves were followed by a point about 30 percent of the time. This was true for all four players: the serving player won a point on roughly 3 out of his or her 10 serves. Mind you, these were for the most part not Aces -- just regular rallies that concluded in a point for the serving team. None of the players used the chainsaw serve popularized by Zane Navratil.

If the chainsaw serve were to result in an immediate Ace 20 percent of the time, it is almost certain that the total percentage of chainsaw serves that are followed by a point would exceed 30 percent. This is true even if 20 percent of the chainsaw serves were hit out. 

Imagine this hypothetical scenario in which a player uses the chainsaw serve:

* 20 percent of chainsaw serves go out or into the net. (This is probably too high, but for the purpose of the argument I want to assume a high failure rate. If the percentage of failed chainsaw serves is lower than 20, it would strengthen my argument.)
* 20 percent of chainsaw serves are Aces (defined here as an immediate point, whether or not the returning player touches the ball with his or her paddle). (This nunber would depend on the skill of the players, of course; I believe a well-executed chainsaw serve would lead to Aces at least 20 percent of the time at the 3.5 level. This percentage would drop as the players' skill level rises.)
* 40 percent of chainsaw serves go in but are not followed by a point for the serving team.
* 20 percent of chainsaw serves go in and are followed by a point for the serving team. (This may seem high, but keep in mind that the chainsaw serve often leads to an ineffective return of serve, which gives the serving team an enormous advantage even if the serve does not result in an immediate Ace.)

In the above scenario, the chainsaw serve is followed by a point 40 percent of the time (half Aces and half not) -- far superior to the 30 percent success rate observed in my recent tournament game.

If the numbers used above are reasonable, the math seems compelling. Please tell me if I am missing something.",1626739864

First post here - been playing PB for 6 months and am in love with it.

Her latest is that the CCRs say it‚Äôs a TENNIS court, with no mention of PB (of course the CCRs are old)

But it‚Äôs dragging on and threatening the PB courts we set up, trying to revert them to the rarely used tennis courts.  

Now the HOA wants to hire mediators in the pro v against PB courts.  An informal survey of the community showed 75% + support for the courts

I play 2-4 times a week and I am very careful with my gear in general. For example: I've only ever dropped a phone twice in my life and I use the lightest, thinnest cases possible because I'm gentle on my stuff. 

Last weekend during play I noticed that the edge guard was no longer flush in two places. It's hard to tell if the guard itself is separating or the paddle face has dented in ever so slightly in those spots. It hasn't impacted how the paddle plays yet, but it gave me pause nonetheless. 

I went to Selkirk's website to get the contact info for customer service, figuring I'd send an email and see if anything could be done. I discovered that they have a simple web form to submit a warranty claim, so I did that. It took less than five minutes and a couple days later after a very pleasant exchange with customer service for some additional info, they approved the warranty claim and are mailing out a brand new paddle!

81,Pickleball,"Why are most paddles rectangular, with corners?","Coming from tennis, a more circular or oval shaped paddle seems more useful. I'll try to hit the ball in the center of the paddle, and likely be off in any direction, so a circular paddle would give me the best odds of making solid contact.

 If pickleball involved scraping the ball off the ground with the ball right in front of me, a flat tip paddle makes sense, but it seems I'm scooping at an angle a lot, so the square corner is the part closest to the ground, which seems less ideal. I may be wrong about the frequency of going after ball at an angle vs  straight in front of me, so the rectangular paddle would make sense in that case.",1625970262
82,Pickleball,Picklesnobs at the local club (Rant),"I am 26 yrs old and I have a more unorthodox method of playing the game compared to most people who think the game should be played with dinks at the net. My style relies heavily on my speed because I like to play further back and hit heavy topspin shots where if the net front opponent is able to get a dropshot on me I have the speed to catch the ball majority of the time and finish the point with a heavy pass shot.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been playing the game for over three years now and win probably 95% of my games. I recently joined the local pickleball club which is mostly made up of 50yr + players who aren't used to speedy players like myself. Since this is my first club i've been a part of, I was automatically registered as  a 3.5 lvl player. To move up the ranks you must play rated games which only take place during the week and since I work I can't attend. So, saturday mornings I go play with the other 3.5's who with all due respect are good players but usually my games finish with a score in the range of 11-5 and very one-sided.

&amp;#x200B;

The president of club asked if I would like to play with some of the other 4.0's and let them decide if I can hold my own with them. I played one game using the style of play I have used for the last three years with complete success with a final score of 11-7 for my partner and I. After the match, the guy on the other side did not even want to tap paddles as a respectful ""good game"" and  says, ""Defintely not a 4.0"" (I thought he was joking at first only to realize he was being serious). ""You hit it too hard"" He says. ""That's not pickleball"". I have people telling me that I need to play the short game just about every time I go to play with a new group, win or lose (though, normally win). I politely said back ""All of my shots beat you clean, why should it matter if I play in the kitchen or not. This is my style of play and it works very well for me"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it was really upsetting to hear because I put on a show digging up balls and putting away difficult shots only to be put down by a guy who was upset that he lost to a young 3.5 being a 4.0. So I guess I will go back to playing with the 3.5's and dominating. I don't think it's fun for them or me to have consecutive blow out games.

While this post may seem to be self-promotional, it really is a valuable resource for the community and gives more than it takes.  
I am excited to share an app my team and I have been working on that makes it easier to meet new dinkers and bangers and connect with your local pickleball community! The app is called Pastimes and while it supports over 90 outdoor activities, Pickleball has been one of the biggest communities we have been focused on. This is because it is not always easy to find others play singles or doubles with. We realized that Facebook Groups have become cluttered and seem to be less and less valuable as a tool to connect people in the real world (following the trend of MeetUp). So we set out to build a modern tool that allows you to build a profile with your location, skill level, years of experience, gear and photos of you doing the activities you love. You then have multiple paths to connect with others who share the same activities. You can also filter just for Pickleball, skill level, location proximity, gender, etc. Another way to connect is through posting availability to get out. You get notified with others have similar availability and can send a message to make plans. Of course, we have the traditional ""Events"" path where you can discover and organize meetups along with tools for group discussion to coordinate plans. We plan to bring in public events from the community such as tournaments and coached clinics too. Last, we just recently added a way to buy, sell, and search/trade gear. This feature could be great for anyone wanting to get into the game but does not yet have a paddle. Check it out at [www.pastimes.io](https://www.pastimes.io) or download on Apple and Android app stores (currently available for download in US, UK and Canada). Sign up to be notified when it is available for download in your country on our website.",1625670868

And also I think the drop serve is just easier for beginners to learn. I mean beginners with zero racket sport experience. I feel like the traditional serve is a bit hard for people to remember the rules for.

However, 9 times out of 10 the only place we'll get to play is on grass. So far we've just been practicing, as the ball doesn't really bounce well on grass.

I've been doing extensive research trying to find an equivical ball that would be more grass friendly and came across the [US Lawn Pickleball Association](https://youtu.be/VVGPVWZDBqw). However, they seem to have magically disappeared in 2018, with 100s asking what ball they were using. To no response.

I have been traveling to various sporting goods stores trying to find a ball that would work and have come up empty handed. After further research I'm thinking a ""kids"" Squash Ball might be perfect, but they are hard to come by.

So, here is my question, does anyone here have experience playing pickleball on grass, and if so, what kind of ball did you use?

30,Pickleball,Hard serves are overrated.,"It is often assumed that a hard serve is a good serve. The harder the better, provided the serve stays in. And so many of us try to imitate Zane Navritil and other hard-hitting pros.

The conventional thinking, however, is not necessarily valid. In a recent social media thread (I think I saw it in a Facebook pickleball forum), several people mentioned that they play better against 4.0s than 3.5s. These people said they prefer to hit hard serves rather than soft ones. 

The reason for this, I suspect, is that soft serves require the returner to add power, which increases the probability of error. 

In my personal experience, serves that are soft, high, and deep are surprisingly effective at the 4.0 level and lower. Many intermediate-level players are not accustomed to dealing with soft serves, particularly deep lob serves.

But players at higher levels -- and even some pros -- make use of soft serves:

39,Pickleball,Let it fly or not?,"I think there is one crucial skill that should be improved all the time for any skill level: it is dodge the ball, let it fly. When the ball goes out it's you point already won. Don't stop it!

Though it's quite obvious statement, it's much easier to say than to do. Even top pros struggle with it. And I'm not  talking about the ball going fast right into your chest from a 15 feet distance. Those are physically hard to let go, and you'd better put paddle on it rather than let it hit your body. Fast ball going close to you from your waist to your shoulder level and even higher often causes your good reflexes to swing and hit the ball, and at the best the rally you already ""won"" continues with who knows what outcome.

When I just started playing pickleball I was using non-dominant left hand (I'm not ambidexter to any stretch, I barely can eat with my left hand). But I had frozen right shoulder and had no other choice. So with all my racket sports experience I definitely was really straggling for the first month or more. I had problems putting the ball where I wanted, I had no power. But because of all that I was really good at letting the ball go. It was my best shot at the time. First, I had no power, so I had absolutely no real advantage hitting overheads and smashes. Second, it all felt awkward and my hand did not go for every ball automatically. Third, my experience in tennis, table tennis, and badminton allowed me to feel if the ball goes out pretty good. And just with this essential skill and dropping/dinking strategy, but no power drives and poor put-aways I was able to be competitive at 4.0 level.

Interestingly enough, when my right arm got out of jail, and I switched hands, and got back all  my trained for years hand-eye coordination and power, I found myself hitting balls going out much more often. Partially that was because of faster reflexes, partially because I got my power and was not ""afraid"" of high balls an more. Since then I'm still trying to work on letting the ball fly better. I noticed that when I specifically focus on this aspect I win significantly more games. The only problem I have with that, I'm getting ""bodybagged"" more often too. As I'm trying to dodge the ball instead of defending myself with a paddle (at the age of 53 I got pretty fast hands, and not that fast body) I get hit in the chest and sometimes even in my head quite frequently.

54,Pickleball,Is it time to Replace Your Shoes?,"First question are you actually using court shoes? There's dozens of types of tennis shoes that work excellent for Pickleball.  When was the last time you replaced your shoes?  

Most Tennis shoe manufacturers recommend replacing your shoes after about 60 hours of hard play.  While that's probably on the extreme early side for pros, that does give us something to judge against. So if you've been playing every day for a year or two in your current pair, then you're probably long past time. But if it's only been a few months and you're not one to get every ball, then maybe you have some more time. 

If you're playing at a high level and blazing around the court you are beating up your shoes pretty hard.  The Midsole padding can get compressed from the extreme forces required to change directions as fast as Pickleball can require. I would argue that singles Pickleball play can be even more demanding than tennis on your shoes ability to absorb impact and redirect.  

Some signs to look for:

* the sole of your shoe is getting worn down
* your knees are hurting during play

So is it time to replace those old things on your feet?",1624379766

I recently tried one and I, personally, was kind of surprised at how much impact  I *thought* it had. I was expecting some improved moisture absorption and that having the circumference of the handle slightly larger might affect how I rolled my paddle for different shots. I do think those occurred.

What I was surprised by was how much I felt it reduced impact/vibration, especially when not hitting square, and particularly how I thought it made it a little bit easier to take pace off the ball and control how much power I was putting into shots and blocks.

Paddle makers and their sponsored athletes and reps want consumers to believe there are enormous differences between paddles.

Yes, there are differences in look and feel but my quality of play does not  change from one paddle to another.

Barring some new technological advance, I'm going to stick with my current paddle -- the ProKennex Kinetic -- until I feel dead spots. Not because it's the best paddle but because it's fine and there is no need to spend $150 - $200 on a replacement.",1624183952

I bought a GoPro knock off for pretty cheap and it comes with a ton of mounting options including a head and body (chest) strap.

I'm gonna experiment with it next week. I've found that by clipping it to an adjustable ball cap worn backwards seems to be the least cumbersome and unobtrusive fit. I can also sync it with my iPhone to see the video while the cam is clipped to my head to make sure I have the proper angle set up. 

I can see where playing lob overheads it may come into a bit of vision hinder.

I play outdoors in the heat in FL and sweat profusely.

I was gonna set it at 1080 @ 60 fps with motion stabilization on and slow motion possible.

81,Pickleball,Kitchen Question,"Hey everyone! I have a question that has been bugging my pickleball group for a couple days now. So, we all know that when you're playing the ball in the air, you can never go anywhere near the kitchen or its line. Not even your hat can touch it while you're volleying. However, you can enter the kitchen if the ball bounces in there, to put it over the net. Now, the question that has bedeviled us is this: Say the ball bounces outside of the kitchen, past the kitchen line. If you then hit it, over the net, after it bounces, and then your momentum carries you into the kitchen, are you good? Or is going into the kitchen after you hit the ball always bad, whether you're volleying or not? Thanks for the help!",1623979223
82,Pickleball,Jay Devilliers on the French Wikipedia,"A little over a month ago, I posted a link on here to a [Wikipedia page I created for Ben Johns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johns). At the time, I believed that it was the first page on all of Wikipedia for a professional pickleball player. On the *American* Wikipedia, that's true. However,  [this page for Jay Devilliers](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Devilliers)  on the French Wikipedia was created long before I created mine for Johns.

I thought that was pretty neat. Firstly, because it means that French Wikipedia users care about Pickleball enough to make a fairly detailed page for their best male player - seriously, check out the translation. Those guys did a much better job than I did. Secondly, because that means there are Wikipedia pages for 3 pickleball professionals now in existence: the two I made, for Ben Johns and [Zane Navratil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Navratil), and the one made by our French friends for the Flying Frenchman.

Why is this important, you may ask? When you search on Google for any given person - an athlete, a politician, or just anyone famous - the first thing that comes up is usually their wikipedia page. There's a Wikipedia page for *everything*. If there isn't a page for it, it's probably not popular enough for people to care about it. Therefore, **having a well-made Wikipedia page for players and other related Pickleball entities legitimizes pickleball.** Therefore, I am commissioning all pickleball players with any knowledge of Wikipedia to create pages for the pros. It takes a lot of research to make these pages correctly, but it's rewarding- and you're playing your part in growing pickleball.

When someone who's never seen Pickleball before tunes in to ESPN and sees Zane Navratil or Ben Johns (or Jay Devilliers if they're French, I guess) playing a Pickleball game, when they run a google search, the wikipedia pages are the first things that will come up. heir first impression of the game will be, ""Wow, this is *legit!*"" That's the kind of free publicity Pickleball needs.",1623973934

That's right! The Soviet Union is a thing! After a quick reverse-image search, I found out that this map is a 1982 map created by the CIA. Why did the IFP decide to use a 40-year-old coldwar map created by the Central Intelligence Agency? I have no idea. But It was funny enough that I decided I should share it somewhere.

The surface texture isn‚Äôt as gritty as the other two paddles I‚Äôve used and doesn‚Äôt seem to grip the ball quite as well for spin. 2. When it was hot and humid out and we were using an X40 ball, I found myself missing the easy pop off the surface that my previous paddles provided.

I like to play up on the kitchen line my wingspan and quick reflexes really shine there.  When receiving the serve I like to put a nice chop spin on the ball, but I don't often spin during a volley.

The thing is, during practice sessions/matches their volley and dinking technique is solid. Like they could hit ten volleys in a row at a target no problem.

34,Pickleball,"Dinking or not, and how it relates to the skill level","Recently in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pickleball/comments/nszgu7/pickleball_mens_doubles_45_game_at_clearone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) people were discussing the level of players on rec pickleball game video. Many people suggested the players were ""no way 4.5"" or even ""beginners"". While video title claims 4.5+ level most players are 5.0s with some medals in open, pro, or 5.0 events in US Open/PPA/APP tournaments. Still some watchers think this were not high level pickleball. Why?

From my experience posting pickleball videos on Facebook there are several reasons for that:

1. Easy trolling. Some people love trolling and this  is very inexpensive way to start. Nothing to discuss here, I believe.
2. There are some ""unforced errors"" (mostly at the beginning of the game). Of course many unforced errors usually mean ""lower level"". The common problem with any ball sport video is that it is really hard to see the speed and spin of the ball. Thus many mistakes made because of high ball speed or heavy spin and unusual bounce as a result of speed and spin look like unforced errors.
3. Video does not have much dinking involved. If players do not dink all the time some watchers (usually lower skill level, 4.0 and below players themselves) think it is the same game as 3.5s do (everyone knows 3.5s do not dink much). It is not the same. The speed is different, the placement is different, the choices made are completely different. Lower level players struggle with dinking (actually they struggle without being able to dink consistently and purposefully). For lower level player dinking is a goal, a sign of higher level play. In a sense it is. If you cannot dink, it's not that hard to leave you out of options at the court. But if you can, dink is just one shot out of many. And the very goal of dinking is to get an attackable ball. So many higher level players dink only when they **can not** attack. Players with fast hands tend to initiate fast exchange at any opportunity in a hope of overspeeding opponents. It's probably not the best strategy ever (even though Ben Johns uses it all the time in mixed) as often having semi-attackable ball you can just make more aggressive dink and have you ball-above-the-net-to-put-it-away with less risk, but it works unless you meet a faster opponent.  
How much dinking would you see in a match 4.5 vs 5.0 or pro vs non-pro in a tournament? Not much really. Most 5.0s want to finish it quick and if they are not forced to dink they will not.  
One of the brightest examples of ""you don't have to dink to win 5.0 tournament"" was the last men's doubles 5.0 match at US Nationals in 2019 when Sobeks won the gold barely dinking at all.",1622995657

So I was trying out a couple different paddles (graphite face/polymer core, and fiberglass/polymer), the graphite does felt ""sharper"". And as I read stuff online I keep coming across this point for paddles: harder face/core gives more power, softer gives more control. 

Here's where I am confused. I've played some other racket sports and usually rackets strung with higher tension gives more control and gets good power from good swings. Lower tension strings gives more power (pop) for beginners as the strings do more of the work, and is much less likely to injure arm/elbow. But soft strings usually does not gives good control.

So how does pickleball, especially with so much dinks, gets more control out of a softer paddle? I must be missing something fundamental so please enlighten me. Thanks.",1621482330

Is this conservative strategy the best approach? Would I be better off attempting higher-difficulty serves even if it means that some of them go out from time to time?

He's older, in his 70s, while the rest of us are in our 20s and 30s for comparison.

I've frequently get matched with him and found he seems to yell at me more than the others. Like if a ball looks like it's going out, he'll yell ""out"" much more loudly which he explained is ""for my own good"" despite others making similar mistakes. When I misunderstood a rule once, he got very close to my face and spoke to me like a child, which was embarrassing. I *feel* like a child around him tbh. I realize the importance of standing up for oneself, so maybe it's a sign to crank this up a bit and be more confident/try not to let it get to me. 

Still I have a match scheduled later today and I'm actually dreading it, mainly because I'm scared of my *own* anger reaction should he push my buttons too far.

37,Pickleball,How Do Pro Matches Work?,"I was watching a couple of Men's singles. And I'm wondering what's with the match system? Particularly the Cincinanati Open Men's Gold with Navratil vs Devilliers. So, Devilliers came out of the loser's bracket and won the first two games (11-0 , 11-3(?, forgot exactly)). But Navratil won the tiebreaker (to 15) and therefore won the match. 

I mean it seems kind of like a waste of time if all Navratil had to do is win that one tiebreaker to win the match. He barely needed to try for two games and then just had to put in real effort for the 3rd game, and he won. Whereas Deviliers was under the pressure of winning all three games. 

Can someone explain the logic behind this for me? This isn't the first championship match I've seen where it was like this. The person in the losing bracket wins the first two games, but loses the third, and therefore lost the match.",1619137493

42,Pickleball,Serving Rules/Courtesy,"So, I do a lot of rec/open play (3-4 times a week). And a majority of the players I play with have illegal serves. Examples:

* having the paddle move from a high to low motion (on a normal serve, not a drop serve)
* the highest part of the paddle is above the wrist

I do call them out every now and then and try to explain the correct serving rules. But they insist the only serving rule (for a regular serve) is that it just needs to be below the navel. I figure, ""well this is just rec play and I don't really want to argue"". 

My question is:

Does anyone else experience this during their rec/open play; where people only follow the ""below the navel"" rule? I can see not trying to be a stickler for every single rule during open play, or ""allowing"" certain actions. But I feel serving rules are kind of the basics.",1619030507

[This page](https://blog.pickleballcentral.com/category/history-of-pickleball/) has some history and says:

&gt; The Dura Fast 40 Ball was developed in 1980 by Pickle-Ball Inc working closely with a family that specialized in unique high performance plastics manufacturing who had also taken an interest in pickleball.

So it seems like the Dura is about 40 years old, but I can't find information on how Onix came to be the manufacturer.

I know that if you're at the kitchen and you struck the ball and then your momentum causes you to step in, it still counts as a fault (even if at point of contact, your feet were outside the kitchen).

My question is, what if the point ends (ex: two bounces) or your opponent hits the ball before your momentum brings you into the kitchen. 

So:

1. You are at the kitchen line and hit a shot (your feet are behind the kitchen line at point of contact.

60,Pickleball,Ratings Calculations,"Forgive me if this subject has already been beaten to death, but a quick search has not provided an accurate answer.

I play in a small market, have no tournament experience, and most locals play casual pick up games a few times per week.  There is little organized play available.   Most players are in the 2.5 to 4.0 range skill-wise.

I am developing an online page where scores may be recorded directly to a Google Sheet where calculations and magic can happen.   I want to begin ""rated round"" matches of 4 or 5 players of random/rotating partners.  Basically each player partners and plays against every other player.

(4 players would play a 3 game set - 5 players would play a 5 game set with each player having one bye)

The ratings would be generated from point differentials of each game via an equation taking into consideration the average ratings of both teams. 

As the system is yet to be implemented, actual data (game scores) is sparse.   I am contemplating where to begin player ratings.  Should all begin at 2.5-3.0 (middle range) or should I begin with self ratings?

I've just not found a detailed ratings guide based on player's performance.  Any ideas or suggestions from the PB community are welcome.  Thanks!",1618501815
61,Pickleball,"In casual play, if a ball lands out of bounds and is played, what is the call?","I often play pickleball (and tennis) with family members and friends. One of the rules I'm unclear on in pickleball is in regards to the ball landing out of play but still being played. In tennis, we play by the rules that if a ball lands out of bounds (and there is no question as to whether it was in or out) and the person receiving the ball plays the ball anyways, that the ball is still determined to be OUT because it landed out of bounds and there are no concerns as to whether it was in our out. This gives the side where the ball landed out an the opportunity to return the ball on the off chance that it lands in bounds, but because it didn't, they get the ball back (or a point). Are these rules normal? I always assumed that a referee in a professional game would just call it out automatically anyways, giving the players the opportunity to return it. I realize casual pickleball is a bit different than casual tennis, but we've had a few instances now where I will go back to return the ball, it lands out of bounds, but I've already wound up and smacked it back, at which time I call it ""OUT"", but it's already on the way back to the opposing team.",1618501326

Website is trash - pickleball page is somewhat annoying to find, so I'll link that as well.

Anyways - I haven't seen very much review info that is relatively new, and certainly not for this updated version. Does anyone have any experience with it? We're really tempted, but if it doesn't work more often than not, we'll probably pass. The fact that it records the court really well is pretty  nice though.. and can instant replay the shot.

96,Pickleball,Played in my first tourney last weekend...,"...and it was kind of a bummer.  (TL;DR at the end if you don‚Äôt want my synopsis)

It was a true open tournament, so no ranking or anything.  You just signed up and played whomever you were matched with, double elimination style.  My partner (39F) and I (42M) realistically only expected to play two matches anyways so we weren‚Äôt thinking we were going to take it down and get hoisted up on the shoulders of those we beat whilst hoisting our gift card trophies in the air.  I‚Äôve only been playing since last spring when my partner decided to get back into it after a 7 year hiatus.  

We did win our first match.  I kind pooped myself a bit when I saw two younger (early 20‚Äôs, maybe even late teens?) females warming up on the court.  My partner and I are pretty much the youngest people in the group we normally play in.  Obviously that doesn‚Äôt equate to wins, but there‚Äôs a certain amount athleticism that we can expect from our usual opponents.  Playing a couple of spring chickens is a complete unknown to us.  

Luckily they weren‚Äôt that good.  We didn‚Äôt dispatch of them handily, but aside from a 7 point run they were able to put together thanks mostly to mistakes by yours truly, the score didn‚Äôt dictate the true pace of the match.  (Final score was 11-8, we had 9 at the start of their run).

High fives and good feelings!  Maybe we might make a dent or two?  Enter the second match...vs the team that probably ended up in the finals match (we didn‚Äôt stick around).  Both great players, 4-4.5.  Best friends with the sponsor table.  Their strategy was basically to hit it directly at us, with some pop - but nothing blazing or dangerous.  This is something we were totally unprepared for, and definitely not used to!  

I get that that‚Äôs pretty much tournament play.  It‚Äôs a viable strategy, but they also had the skills to back up traditional play when we were able to finally counter and get rallies going.  Unfortunately we lost 4-11, though the spectators (people we had been playing with all summer/winter) did have some encouraging things to say to us after the match.  So that was nice.  

Enter our last match.  We played possibly what ended up being the 3rd or 4th seed.  They had just lost to the team that probably ended up winning the tournament.  Had this match been my introduction to Pickleball, I probably would have taken two weeks off and then quit.  

I believe these guys are what are considered ‚Äòsmashers‚Äô.  Anything that comes to them seemingly above the knee is coming back in your general direction as hard as they can hit it.  Fairly athletic father/son team.  There really wasn‚Äôt anything we could do.  

If I could do it all over again, I would have played the baseline and lobbed them to death or baited them to *actually hit a dink* (which I can usually recover from the baseline 90% of the time - I‚Äôm faster than I look).  It‚Äôs just frustrating because I know if we could have somehow gotten past their relentless salvo, they didn‚Äôt have much else to their game.  

It just wasn‚Äôt fun, didn‚Äôt seem very sporting, but - it‚Äôs tourney play.  You do what you do to win.  My partner and I play at a 3-3.5 level - so we were obviously overmatched, I get it.  But this begs a question: 

Are the last two matches really typical of tourney play?  A lot of the pro matches I watch end up being a lot more strategic and methodical rather than brute force - but could that be because they‚Äôre all so good where brute force doesn‚Äôt work?

The shots we faced in that tournament don‚Äôt really happen in rec play (where we play) because...I assume most people don‚Äôt find that very fun.  How do you even practice to counter? Is this typical play in the 3-3.5 skill levels?  Should I burn my paddle and play hopscotch instead?

A friend of mine wants to take me to play tennis this weekend. I've played tennis before, but not very well and not for a very long time. I know the basic mechanics of the game, but I'm wondering if you guys have any tips. 

What's the same? What's different? Do I even have a chance of hitting the balls in, or is the game so different that I won't stand a chance? Since the court is so ludicrously huge, do I even have a chance of hitting the balls out? How are the strokes different? How is the play different? Etc, etc.

Since athletic ability is important in tennis, it's worth noting that I am a fairly fit 18-year-old male. There shouldn't be much of a problem in that regard. Thanks for any help or advice you can give. Let's hope I don't get humiliated too badly.",1615830710

After trying out a couple different types; wood, aluminum, etc. I'm come to realize that I'm looking for a paddle that is the ""bounciest"", for lack of a better term.

What do I mean by bounciest? I'm trying to infer that I'm looking for a paddle that the ball will ""bounce"" off of with the lowest amount of force from myself hitting the ball. A better analogy might be; if I were to drop a ball from 6ft up onto a paddle, which type of material will let it bounce back up the most?

19,Pickleball,"Can we talk about Joe Baker's video, ""Doubles Pickleball Strategy 106: Return the Serve Like a Pro""","I think we've discussed this video before, but I'd to revisit it. Here's the video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFHkDIW0wOo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFHkDIW0wOo)

The main insight of this video is that pro players typically do not hit their serves particularly deep. I assume this is because pros impart enormous spin on their returns of serve and need large margins of error to account for the possibility of a cut shot gone awry.

Baker argues the following:

\-most rec players  would be better off hitting very conservative returns of serve near the center (or just right of center) of the opponents' court;

\- It is OK for a player with a weak backhand to ""run around the ball"" and use his forehand on his retrun of serve , because there is plenty of time to move into the correct position prior to the next shot; and

\- players should always hit lobs or semi-lobs on the return of serve rather than line drives so that they can get fully to the line before the 3rd shot comes back.

Do you all agree with Baker? 

Is it sometimes worth it to hit a more aggressive return of serve even if it goes out from time to time?For example, let's say I can hit a pretty good return-of-serve straight ahead of me up the alley to my opponent's backhand. If the opponent has a strong forehand and a weak backhand, I would argue that the shot is worth it if I hit it out less than, say, 15 percent of the time. 

Is it really a good idea to move way to the side to avoid using a weak backhand? Doesn't that tell your opponent, ""My backhand is terrible""? In tournament play, I would want to avoid conveying that information to strangers.

Is it really the case that a fast, hard, line drive return-of-serve should \*always\* be avoided? I would think that this would be a good idea every now and then, just to mix things up.",1614792587

21,Pickleball,"6 Kitchen-Entry, Hitting, &amp; Serving Rules Questions","Started playing about 13 months ago, and have been playing 1-3 times per week since then. (I‚Äôm getting damn good!) Hoping you all can help me out and let me know if the way my buddies and I play is correct! Some of these rules we‚Äôve been taught, some we‚Äôve concluded as the result of controversies. We also play by ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs rules,‚Äù so everything is in good faith (i.e., don‚Äôt call an out or a foul unless it‚Äôs clear, player calling out or foul is presumed correct unless overruled by teammate). 

1) No kitchen foul if a player enters the kitchen without the ball landing in the kitchen, so long as that player does not touch or play the ball prior to exiting the kitchen. 

2) If a player hits a shot (usually a spike in this situation) and begins to fall into the kitchen, there is no kitchen foul if he steps into the kitchen so long as the ball lands on the opposite side first. 

3) The ‚Äúdouble-hit‚Äù by one player is not a foul so long as the double-hit occurs in one single, smooth, and consistent swinging motion.

4) If a ball lands in play and travels outside of the boundaries, the player does not need to cause the ball to cross over the net. (For example, ball bounces in play once, floats 3 feet outside of the outside-line, and the returning player hits the ball lower than the height of the net which lands in play.)

5) If a returning player‚Äôs teammate prematurely and incorrectly calls a ball out, and the returning player successfully returns the ball, a let is called and there is a redo. (This is controversial, and this is why I yell ‚Äúbounce it‚Äù as opposed to the affirmative ‚Äúout‚Äù call. Typically the premature ‚Äúout‚Äù call is made to assist the teammate rather than to make a call on the court, which is why we play it as a let, basically just as a good faith rule. Would also make sense that an incorrect affirmative ‚Äúout‚Äù call should be a lost point.)

6) A serve must be made with an upward swing plane which may not be even with the court. (Question is how to call this? Is it just a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs rule‚Äù or is there a way an official in a tournament would see this?)

New to this sub, apologize if these have already been answered, and thank you in advance!",1614781380
22,Pickleball,"My opponents, who were receiving serve, positioned themselves incorrectly on purpose.","This happened in rec play the other day. Toward the end of a game, our opponents got into position to receive. My partner positioned himself to serve to the opponent who was at the baseline. At the last second, I realized my partner was about to serve from the wrong side of the court! (If you serve from the wrong side of the court, it's an automatic point for the other team.) I told him in time and he moved to the correct side of the court.

I knew my opponents (who are very savvy) would not make a dumb mistake with regard to receiving position. So I asked them if they had lined up incorrectly on purpose in order to provoke a serving error by us.  Of course, this is exactly what they had done. When they told me, I couldn't help but be impressed by their creativity.

3. Jay Devilliers (big time up and coming star who is in the medal matches week in and week out)

4. Kyle Yates- look at his history of winning big tournaments. Only reason I have him at 4 and not 1 or 2 is his past year has faced difficulties getting to the podium.

28,Pickleball,Return-of-serve set-up - some questions about the rules,"My partner and I have begun 3/4 stacking on return of serve. Because we are new at this, it is easy to make a mistake. My partner relies on me to figure out where we need to be so that she can focus on hitting the ball. Typically, I like to take a few seconds to do the following:

1) confirm the score if I am unsure,

2) think about where my partner and I need to be on the court, 

3) direct my partner to her proper location, and

4) walk or jog to our proper places.

The whole process usually takes 5-10 seconds. The amount of time will decline as we get used to stacking on return of serve.

In rec play, I simply raise my paddle and say  ""hold on a second please."" In tournament play, however, I'm not sure this is allowed. Obviously, I can use a time-out if needed, but I would prefer to preserve my time-outs if possible.

**Question: Without using a time-out, can the team returning the serve ask the server to delay his or her serve for a few seconds?**

If not, what other legal options do I have to delay the serve in tournament play? For example, if the ball is on my side of the court, can I hold on to the ball for a few seconds before tossing it to my opponents? If I am walking back to the baseline, can I buy time by walking slowly, extending the amount of time my back is turned to the server? I assume the server cannot serve if my back is turned to him or her.",1614073822

63,Pickleball,Pickleball Hosted Housing: Travel. Meet New People. Save Money.,"Pickleball is a sport that is ripe for hosted housing.¬† We love our sport. We love our fellow players. We love to travel and play at new venues.¬† Here's my blog detailing more on why I set up a hosted housing site on Facebook, and how all pickleball players can join and participate.¬† By growing this into a larger community, there are greater benefits for all of us. More people to host, more places to travel, more people to meet. Thats a win/win/win.

Recently, I signed up for a tournament. Needing a partner for mixed doubles,¬† I connected with a man I had never met.¬† What he wrote in¬†an email to me is on point and exactly how I feel, and is precisely why I have a hosted housing group on Facebook.¬† Here is what he wrote:

¬†*""****If you and your husband want to stay at our place in Vegas when you are here for the tournament let me know. Don‚Äôt feel obligated because we realize that many of our friends want to be closer to the strip when they visit.¬†I guess it says something about Pickleball players that I would offer my home to someone I have never met.¬†""***

This last line particularly resonates; this man felt connected with someone who is a pickleball player, who he exchanged emails with but had never met.¬† This has been true in my encounters with people I meet through pickleball. Invariably, I meet so many interesting people who I invariably like, who I enjoy spending time with, and who I'd welcome into my home.¬†

So, am I going to take my new partner¬†up on his offer?¬† You bet I am. First,¬† ""trust"" goes two ways. I am glad that he feels comfortable with me, but I feel similarly about him. He's a thoughtful, educated professional, who loves to travel, and who plays pickleball all the time.¬†What's not to love? ¬† Next,¬†staying with a new person is a¬†lovely opportunity to¬†get to know someone better.¬†¬†Frankly, staying with someone also allows me to save money on lodging¬†which only allows me to travel more with my penchant for¬†""destination"" pickleball.¬†¬†

So, here's the link:¬†¬†[Picklebilly Hosted Housing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3746620065377220)

65,Pickleball,How to care your Pickleball Paddle? Pickleball Paddle Maintenance Guide.,"Some people are really serious about taking care of their pickleball paddle, and they always want to maintain a tip-top condition for that. Others may take care of it occasionally, but they barely worry about the marks and ringing sound that occurs while playing.

And, there is another group, including myself (also can be you), who doesn‚Äôt afford to buy a new pickleball paddle every year.  

So, people like me can consider a pickleball paddle as a long-term investment. That‚Äôs why you want to take care of it properly. Taking care of your pickleball paddle will not ensure that it will last a lifetime.

81,Pickleball,"What is the right amount of time to ""hold a court"".","Hey guys, 

So I am new to this sport, and loving it. My friends and I are all in our thirties, and usually enjoy playing doubles at a local park with the 4 of us. 

Seeing as pickleball is big in South Florida, the park is usually packed at night between 6 and 9. A few times, we have arrived during a busy time, and when the courts were full, simply moved over to an open tennis court, marked lines with bean bags, and made the best of it. 

This past weekend, we got to a court, and started playing. After we finished our first game, an older lady (probably in her 60's) with her group of 4 asked me ""if I had been here before"". I responded ""no"", and she told me that ""it is normal to rotate the losing team of two out, and allow a new team of two to play.""  I responded that I did not know, and looked around at the 5 other courts, and wondered why they did not ask the other groups playing (who had all been there before us). I kinda shrugged it off, and started a new game with my group. I checked the park website, and the rule is each group can have the court for one hour, this rule is not posted anywhere on the court. 

Anyway, I do not want to be rude, am new to the sport, and just wanted to know how you all would handle this situation. Personally, I would rather not be forced to play with strangers. I think it would be obnoxious to stay on the court longer for an hour if people are waiting, but being forced to move after only one game seemed kinda dumb. Also, how hard am I supposed to play against people who are older and in much worse shape than me? I feel like I am now placed in a tough position between playing to win and being respectful.",1611597544

## While playing our favorite sport, being hit with the ball can be scary. When the ball whizzes straight at you like a missile, your heart rate jumps, and it stings if it connects. It can leave bruises and could potentially be dangerous. Although being hit with the ball is part of the game, it can cause conflict on the court. Some players are offended if they are hit; some get their feelings hurt as if their opponent is hitting them purposefully.

## While I do not enjoy bruises or painful stings, I go onto a court with the full awareness I may be hit, and my philosophy is ""Bring it on!"" I purposefully choose not to be afraid of the ""little wiffleball"" (which is what I call it to boost confidence) and I empower myself with the reminder to keep my paddle up for protection as the wall which keeps me safe.

## I've hit plenty of people with the ball, especially when the ball is hit high and it's an easy slam to make the point. When I hit someone, I apologize-- I never want to hurt someone.

34,Pickleball,How do you plan on serving under the new rules?,"As many of us know, on 1/15/21, the new service rule will allow us to serve by letting the ball bounce off the ground before hitting it. The only rule is that only gravity can affect the ball falling, meaning you can't impart any force to the drop. Once you do, there are no specific rules around how you hit the ball. Normal serving rules (underhand stroke, hitting below navel, paddle under wrist) no longer apply. 

So my question is, what's your plan? What are your ideas for ""abusing"" this? New techniques? Do you think you can eek out any advantages from serving like this?",1608216808

I hit it into the net every time, even though I know it‚Äôs coming. I get low, and sometimes even try to slice it back. Mostly it still goes into the net. Any advice?

54,Pickleball,Picklebilly Gem: Gregg Whitfield,"How surprising to see a top-ranked player making time to play pickleball with players of all levels. We've all seen the whirlwind discussions on Facebook about pickleball players who are choosy about who they will play with. And yes, we can agree that top-notch players have earned the right to play with players of a similar caliber; however, in the dynamic pickleball world, skill levels, friendships, competitiveness, and kindness are sometimes pitted against each other. Less skilled players sometimes feel dejected or indignant in trying to get in games with better players. 

Refreshingly, at our local courts, I continued to see a pickleball player, who also happens to be a national champion, playing games with everyone. I knew I had to interview him; happily, he agreed!

So, who is Gregg Whitfield? First some background. Gregg Whitfield was introduced to pickleball in 2016; he quickly became addicted to our favorite sport and developed his game to become a 5.0 player. Check out a list of pickleball accomplishments below. Gregg's background is in tennis. He graduated from college with a degree in physical education and became a teaching tennis professional for 10 years at a So. Cal. Club. He loves living in Cambria, a coastal small town in central California where he plays pickleball, and also enjoys fishing, surfing, hunting, snorkeling, and shelling.

**1. Here's what I have to know.¬†¬†Understandably, high ranked players mostly to play with those of the same caliber.¬†¬†And yet, I have seen you frequently out on the courts playing with players of all abilities.¬†¬†Why do you do this?**¬†

## I enjoy playing to promote pickleball as I believe¬†it to be the best lifetime sport and recreational activity for exercise and health. I just want to help others get better which will enhance the lives of themselves and others.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. When you play with ""lesser"" players, is there something you do which helps improve your own game?**

As in real estate, it is location, location, location. I slow the ball down and work on the ball control¬†to place my shots so it keeps the ball in play and also reduces the chance of the opponent putting the ball away.

**3. You're an amazing athlete.¬†What's one thing you're still working on to improve in pickleball?**

## Shot selection, which is what shot you decide to hit. Whether playing against better players or weaker players, the first decision is whether you attempt to win the point or extend the rally. Are you going to hit an offensive or defensive shot? In some sports, like golf, you have more time to think about it. In pickleball, you have to make decisions very quickly. I often ask myself, why did you try that shot? Overall, you should try shots that you have a higher percentage of hitting accurately.

**4. Most of our readers know nothing about the Shangrila otherwise known as Cambria, CA. Do you want to let out the secret about your slice of paradise?**

## Cambria has 6 of the most beautiful courts in the world. Combine that with the cooler weather, I don't understand why other players from the hotter areas don't drive 30 minutes to play in Cambria. There are always open courts Monday to Saturday because Cambria does not have a large group of active players and even more so during covid.

What does everyone make of Joe Baker's video regarding returning (like the pros) 

It's a great discussion worth watching but in short his philosophy is:  too much emphasis is put on returning super deep, and the top players are actually returning mid and very safe on average.

I did crack open a few pro matches on youtube afterwards and the analysis seemed to hold up.

Personally I've been idealising the super deep return every time (which admitedlly does overcook every now and  then) , but now I'm rethinking to change my default to the safer middle shot, keeping it low, towards the backhand.",1604904629

1. It seems to state that ""composite"" can refer to a paddle's core: "" Composite Pickleball Paddle refers to a type of paddle, which has been made using a *mixture of ingredients. A combination of a polyester and Nomex content is typically used while making a composite paddle core.* After the combination of these contents, they produce a foam-like body that offers a silent and softer texture.""
   1. ""Composite"" refers to a paddles face - not its core - right? 
   2. It only mentioned Nomex but there are tons of polypropylene cores inside composite paddles, right?
2. It states that graphite paddles are heavier than composite paddles: "" On the other hand, the graphite pickleball paddles are made of Graphite, which is a hard material. So, the graphite pickleball paddles are relatively heavier. "" It's actually the opposite, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

18,Pickleball,How to capitalize on various types of returns.,"Being able to recognize and differentiate different types of returns.

I see a lot of people hitting one type of motion for drops and dinks. And I think this contributes to why people dont consistently make drops and dinks. I get not everyone has the ability to do what im about to say and theres nothing wrong with that at all. I understand they are just focusing on making their shot, but I feel that various third shots and dinks can be hit with slightly different motions and arcs to increase efficacy and consistency. Forgive me and let me know if im not explaining this well. Feel free to contribute to what im talking about as well.

1. Deep return w/ spin, decent amount of pace and some height.

These returns are some of the best opportunities to drop into the corners and get a nice angle. They feel very fluid and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù because youre just taking the spin/pace on the ball and capitalizing on it sitting slightly up. Assuming continental grip, on your backhand side, you can slice more down and through on these. I dont mean actually swinging high to low, but when you initially make contact it youre making contact with your paddle on top of the ball and swinging slightly down and then going through the slice low to high. After you make contact the low to high motion is the follow through, and what guides the ball. When youre getting the paddle to its contact point you want the face to be square to the net not open. This is a common slice mistake, where people are approaching slices with an open paddle face and using a low swing and getting minimal leverage on the ball. I think hitting drops off these types of returns feels the most fluid and effortless. You dont really have to worry about the arc of the drop, because the spin and height of the return is allowing you to get a lot of feel on your shot. Tennis players know what im talking about, when you can just deflect a slice or topspin ball back and really control/feel the ball on the racket for a long time. This same idea applies for balls on the forehand side, you can roll over the shot and swing through the ball more, granted youre keeping a loose grip. When the ball is slightly up and has spin, you have a much easier chance to also hit it back with topspin. Keeping a loose grip on these and following through is key. Generating topspin in pickleball is not easy, so recognizing the best opportunities to do so is very important. If you notice your opponent isnt sprinting to the line after every return(a lot of people dont) , aim for the area between the kitchen line and the transition zone. Of course be mindful of poaching, but this is capitalizing on your opponent being slow and also giving you much more room to work with, therefore increasing the likelihood of making the shot.   

2. Deep flat return with pace and height

I think these are good opportunities to hit drives. If its pushing you back obviously not, but I think any time a ball is coming at you with pace, you have the chance to deflect that power back and give your opponent a lot less time to react. If you hit the drive and are still in the transition zone, thats fine. Just make sure you set your feet and keep a strong base. Prepare for shot that would screw you over if you werent set. Hopefully you hit a good enough drive to either win the point or a 5th shot back that you can put away or dink with spin/angle. Its fine to get to the line off the 5th shot. People dont always realize this.

3. Return to the transition zone with no pace.

These are great opportunities to hit drives. Probably the highest percentage for your drives. If the return is sitting up, you can come over the top and get it to spin down at your opponents feet. These returns are obviously closer to the net therefore giving your opponent less reaction time. Hitting drops with topspin and angles are also good opportunities on these returns. Any time the ball is sitting up, you have the time to do more with it. People tell me I ‚Äúhold the ball on my paddle‚Äù for a long time and it confuses them because its hard to tell where im hitting this. The only reason im able to do this is because Im getting very low and also capitalizing on shots that dont have a lot of spin and are sitting up high. Im not saying you cant hit topspin shots on low balls, but to consistently hit spin on lower shots, your footwork needs to be firing on all cylinders at all times. That means bending and getting down low on every single shot. In tennis, you can feel the ball on the strings for so long and brush over balls that have nothing on them. In pickleball, not so much. Thats why im talking about recognizing the best opportunities to hit balls back with spin. 

4. Low returns with a lot of spin.

On these returns it is important to be more aware of the arc that is required to make a solid drop. Try to aim to have the apex of your shot be over the NVZ line of your own side. On the backhand I slice these but less aggressively and emphasize getting them to loop more. On the forehand side I try to get very low and put some spin on them if I can, but if I cant I just focus on getting the arc right so it drops into the kitchen and they have to let it bounce. 

I know that was a lot and I definitely rambled a bit, so I apologize if some of that didnt make sense. A lot of what I wrote about third shots also applies to dinking. Try to think about what im saying here, because it will help you start to do things to returns that youre actually able to. I was trying to hit topspin and slice drops and drives to the corners off returns I realized just arent suitable for. The third shot drop is the hardest shot for a lot of people and driving balls that you are afraid to drop seems like a cop out.",1602024430

Then, 4.B.6.b continues: ""When the team‚Äôs score is even (0, 2, 4 ...), the team‚Äôs starting server‚Äôs correct position is at the right/even serving area. When the team‚Äôs score is odd (1, 3, 5...), the starting server‚Äôs correct position is at the left/odd court.""

Followed by 4.B.6.c: ""After each side out, service begins with the player correctly positioned on the right/even side of the court according to the team‚Äôs score. This player is referred to as ‚ÄúServer 1‚Äù and the partner is ‚ÄúServer 2.‚Äù""

My questions:

1. How do I reconcile 4.B.6.a and 4.B.6.b? If the score at side-out is 3-5-1, does the serve still begin from the right/even serving area? I must be missing something obvious here as a newb.

77,Pickleball,Got to thinking,"I started out playing racquetball and naturally, when COVID hit, had to find something else. Glad I found pickle ball. 

Been playing for a couple months and then it hit me... with how fast it is growing, is there anything publicly traded out there? ESCA bought out ONIX a while back. Wish I‚Äôd known back then. It was trading for $4/share and now up over $17. 

Seems to me like a great long term as ONIX is obviously a huge presence and the sport isn‚Äôt going to slow down. 

Just thought I‚Äôd let my fellow pickle ball friends know. 

Also, what paddles are you guys using. I started out with the bulldog paddle off of Amazon. I‚Äôm actually super happy with it being a $30 paddle. 

Anyone upgraded? And what differences have you noticed?",1596731933
78,Pickleball,Two strategies for approaching the kitchen after a well-executed third shot drop--which is better?,"Assuming the third shot drop is good, which is the better strategy:

A: rush to the line as quickly as possible.

B: take a few steps forward and pause mid court to return the ball. Then move to the kitchen after the 5th shot.

Standard advice seems to be A, but some people recommend B. The reason for this is to better handle a 4th shot that is hit at an angle to the side. This shot can be hard to hit when moving forward rapidly. Basically, the forward-moving player will ""overshoot"" the ball and will have to reach back awkwardly.",1596718926

81,Pickleball,Rule Question,Yesterday I was playing when my teammate hit a high back spin shot that bounced on our opponent‚Äôs side and back on to our side.

Is this true?,1596636138
82,Pickleball,Conflict With my Dad,"Since the shutdown, my family and I have been playing tons of pickleball. It has been one of the main activities keeping us sane throughout the pandemic. 

While I love playing pickleball with all of my family, I have run into a problem with my Dad. Almost every time we play he makes at least one, if not a few, out-of-bounds calls that I find completely objectionable. Even when I am staring directly down the outer line on his side and am almost sure that the ball lands on the line, he insists that the ball is out.

I know that it is good etiquette to let your opponent call out-of-bound shots on their side, but I feel as though it has gotten out of hand. I'm sure that I am wrong about some of his calls, but the frequency of this issue has gotten to the point where it is ruining the game for us.

How should I go about fixing this issue? Should I just suck it up, or is there a good way to compromise?",1596597996
83,Pickleball,Rule 6.D.6 Requesting an Opponent to Make a Line Call,"Rule 6.D.6 states: ""6.D.6. Requesting opponent‚Äôs help.

If the opponents cannot make a clear ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù call, then the ball is considered ‚Äúin‚Äù. The moment the receiving player/team asks for the opponent‚Äôs opinion, they lose their right to make any subsequent ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù call."" 

Can anyone, preferably someone who's a referee or done some of the training explain what subsequent means here? By definition, the rule says you cannot make anymore line calls the rest of the game.",1596593430

If a lob looks like it is going long with 90% probability, just let it go. Dodging likely out balls is more important in tournaments than in rec games because doing so is energy efficient.

Naturally, I‚Äôm the strongest player in the group but there are few very good players and our open play can get competitive. It has gotten to the point where players only hit the ball towards my partner. Once I noticed it, I started toning it down. I‚Äôll never miss on purpose, I‚Äôve never really poached, and now I won‚Äôt hit every shot as a winner. After weeks of taking it easier, it hasn‚Äôt gotten much better. If it were a tournament, I‚Äôd understand. But I want to have as much fun as everyone else during open play. The way I see it, it would be like not hitting it to the weaker player because you know they‚Äôll probably miss it. That wouldn‚Äôt be fun.

9,Pickleball,Change my view: the lob is underutilized in competitive play,"I just watched the [2019 US Open Men's doubles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVwGDC8BP6c&amp;t=3155s) while eating lunch and it made me think.

Yates lobbed Weinbach, an older player and a little less agile, a couple times and it seemed to work out pretty well when he successfully lobbed. There was a time or two where his lob was short and Weinback punished him with an overhead smash.

Everyone talks about the 3rd shot drop. It's a necessary tool in the arsenal but like a messed up lob, if you bungle the ball you can easily put it up where the opponent can smash it.

I think that the lob is underutilized. If people practiced the lob with the same frequency they practiced the down the line drive or  cross court dink it would be more consistent. Right now it seems to not be a widely used shot, and thus is under-practiced. 

The benefits of a good lob:

1. Push opponent back

2. Tire opponent more

3. Force a difficult shot 

4. Create chaos

The costs of a lob are mostly from the chance of an unsuccessful lob: you give the opponent an easy smash or you hit the ball out. 

In my view, if you practiced the lob to get as consistent as your 3rd shot drop, you could drastically change the flow of the game and win more games.

I've never played in a tourament and I play with people 30 years my senior, so I don't often utilize the lob shot because it seems cheap. But it seems that the competitive side of pickleball doesn't use it enough either.",1594250574

57,Pickleball,Old school?,"Let me preface by saying I started out a tennis player before pickleball. 

I first got involved at my local park with an older crowd I'm a younger guy (early 20s). Fun folks. Very welcoming. Even lent me a paddle to play for the first time. Was so damn fun I went to my local walmart and picked up a set of onix ""recruit"" paddles. set came with two rackets and two balls. 

Here's the thing. They are both made of wood. I played with a graphite paddle first time round which felt very effortless but then I started playing with the wood and to my surprise it felt just like a tennis racket. From the feel of the ball to pickup shots and everything else. 

Next thing I know. My power, accuracy, and even spin become even better after playing several times Only complaint about it is the handle feels to short. Mind you this is a 6.5 inch handle and my grip is 3 or maybe 4 fingers deep. This rounding out why my style of stroke is very ""tennis"" so to speak.

So my question is, if I get to competitive play is a wooden racket allowed ? If so what are the paddle regulations if any?",1589585327

60,Pickleball,Help resolving a rules question and refusal to listen,"So I‚Äôll start off this post by saying that I am fairly new to pickleball, only really jumped into it around two months ago but had played it before. That being said I love improving everyday and spend time watching YouTube videos about tutorials and guides almost everyday. I also am pretty good with rules and am able to recall most of the obscure ones if I have at least once. 

Tonight while we were playing my partner hit a ball that had bounced outside of the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù (I‚Äôll refer to it as that as it colloquial name for some added context) and his momentum carried him into the kitchen. After a couple more shots we finally scored the point but then of the players said that my partner went into the kitchen on the shot I mentioned. 

The most veteran player then said that‚Äôs a fault then and no point is scored. I was pretty sure that it was an alright shot but wanted to double check. Once I was off I did a quick google search and found that I had remembered the rule correctly. 

Once we were done playing I took the veteran player aside and asked him. He doubled down on it being a fault. I explained the real name of the kitchen being the nonvolley zone and that name being self explanatory; you can‚Äôt volley in it. I even showed him where pickleball USA had answered this specific question. He then said well I‚Äôve only called it the kitchen and every tournament I‚Äôve been in agrees with me about that rule. At this point I knew he wasn‚Äôt budging so I dropped it. 

So my questions to all of you are:

1. Was I right about the rule? Cam momentum carry you into the kitchen after hitting a ground ball that originated outside of the kitchen?

2. How can I help our play group implement and play this rule correctly when the veteran strongly disagrees?",1589433475

Rally Tyro Pro 2

Does anyone have anything to share regarding these options or have any others I should be looking at? 

The Head Xtreme head shape really appeals to me for some reason. I'm can't put my finger on it but the diamond shape just seems right to me. The whole one piece thing seems awesome to me as well. As a hockey player one piece sticks are so far superior to the other options. Not sure if this actually matters at all but I like the concept. 

I love the fact the Neo is made in USA. Also Selkirk seems to be a big favorite around every site I find.

I was wanting to play not a coaching session. He was a very good player but had old school thinking of ""you should never drive the ball against good players"" and when you're serving you're ""on defense"" and drop pretty much every ball, and go slowly to the kitchen.  I think the game has developed past this mentality that sometimes it is correct to drive the ball hard on a 3rd shot to get a little closer to the kitchen and do a 5th shot drop for example, and there's definitely a place for hard shots. etc. 

I consider myself between a 3.5 and 4.0 player and I recently been having fun developing skills and playing, but my games have been a lot more speed and power and less touch.

Looking online it appears that is legal to call a ball out then play it in pickleball but coming from tennis I have never thought it was legal to change your mind about a ball. If you made a out call you instantly lose the point if the ball lands in. You were able to say things like ""watch it"" ""heads up"" or something to that degree to your partner but not yell ""out.""

Pros

\-The weight felt balanced (not top-heavy).

\-The unibody construction was very sturdy.

\-The way the ball comes off the paddle is very interesting and I think Gearbox is on to something.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons

\-It feels ""off"" at the net. Volleys and soft shots were very bad compared to my Selkirk S2.

\-Their claim about no dead spots is a sham. Plenty of dead areas around the edges.

\-Seems to scuff rather easily, but that's probably expected given this type of paddle.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think Gearbox is on to something with the unibody construction and the way the ball comes off the paddle; I can't really describe it other than saying it feels dampening (in a good way) compared to a traditional multilayered paddle. That said, they really need to fix the issue with dead spots and soft play at the net; for those reasons alone, I have to stick with my Selkirk S2 because I've found myself losing so many easy points.",1581348743

Its a little silly compared to tennis, you can spin the ball but it doesnt do much damage, serve not really a weapon like tennis.  I think the raquets n balls need a little more research to make the ball more workable with spin.  Im a spin doctor and i couldnt generate much.  The ball and paddle are too slick.

79,Pickleball,Mixed doubles strategy,"Played a 4.5 mixed double tournament recently. I‚Äôm only commenting on the strategy of these particular games. 

Every EVERY shot was directed towards the female player. She got beat up all day. I touched the ball 5-8 times in 3 games. In these particular cases, it was very effective. 

There is a thought in philosophical debates that it is more noble to attack the stronger aspects of the opponent rather than the weaker points of the argument. It also sharpens your own ability as it allows for a higher level of discussion. 

Now: I didn‚Äôt know how to correct/overcome this strategy so I‚Äôm posting in hopes of someone helping me understand better double‚Äôs strategy when it is clearly a game of ‚Äúkeep-away‚Äù. I understand stacking and delayed stacking however, that only changes the side of the court that is attacked. 

Now grant it, every team was a mixed double so obviously we weren‚Äôt able to adopt this strategy in an effective way. It‚Äôs also very possible that, either that day or in general, she isn‚Äôt a 4.5 so this strategy worked increasingly well. I‚Äôm only observing the implementation and thusly asking how to combat it. 

I am in no way commenting on her particular play. She really did her absolute best for that particular day. Im upset with myself for not having a game plan to help us combat it accordingly. I‚Äôm grateful to have played in the tournament. It‚Äôs always great getting out there to expand the community.

38,Pickleball,Insane value for newbies,"My family and I have only been into pickleball for about a week. First I ordered two paddles from [pickleballcentral.com](https://pickleballcentral.com). We had so much fun that first night (trading off between my wife and I and our two youngest) that I ordered two more paddles so we could do doubles. Then my adult son came with us the next time, and was interested when I mentioned the mystery box at pickleballcentral. (He can just find 3 other friends and have everything they need to play.)  In case you haven't heard of it, you'll get 4 composite paddles (they state that it will be between $289 and $409 MSRP), 12 balls, a duffle bag, and assorted swag, all for $99. The paddles might be gently used or demo paddles, the balls probably won't be Dura Fast 40s, but they'll be acceptable.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the mystery box came today and we were floored at the goodies contained therein. I'm a little leery of posting exactly what came in the box, because it is a mystery box and what came in ours doesn't necessarily predict what'll be in any other one. That said, two of the paddles are over $100 new (I'd just purchased one of them as my original 4, and was looking at the other one). The other two are pretty good, I think they're about $50 and $40 new. Seriously, just getting those 2 paddles would have been well worth the $99. Shout out to pickleballcentral, they really did us a solid. Oh, and I have no affiliation with them. We've just placed three orders with them all in the space of about one week.",1562909329
39,Pickleball,Rule Question regarding the ball hitting the opponent.,"I'm fairly certain that if the ball ever hits the opponent (especially prior to bouncing) then the point is yours. This arose during my play today and my shot hit the top of my opponent's shoe as he was standing behind the baseline. No doubt my shot would have been out, although my interpretation of the rule is that the point goes to my team in this case?  I believe this excerpt from the official rules applies: &gt;7.F. The ball in play strikes a player or anything the player
is wearing or carrying. There is one exception to this
rule: if the ball strikes the player‚Äôs paddle hand below
the wrist, the ball is still in play. If the ball strikes a
player standing out of bounds before a fault has
occurred, that player loses the rally. In doubles, if the
serve strikes the receiver‚Äôs partner, it is a point for the
serving team, providing it is not a let serve or a fault
serve. This rule also includes balls that appear to be hit
out of bounds: during play, if you catch the ball or try
to stop it from heading out of bounds, you lose the
rally.  Could someone help weigh in on the interpretation of this rule please?",1562541912

Looking to pick up some pickleball paddles for the girlfriend and I we have been playing with people lately more but borrowing their paddles.

I also have a feeling though that some of these pickleball paddlels are overpriced for what they actually are. Does anyone have recommendations for a paddle with good/decent performance but also at a fair price? best bang for the buck type scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I love how much easier it is to get out and have some fun with people playing pickleball in comparison to Tennis.

Over the years we have integrated more drills into the classes, but this is ""boring"" to the students, who are all well over our age (25) and we don't often get respect because of our age. 

It's a 6 week class that meets for one hour a week. In the beginning we work on dinking and volleying, move on to a 2 on 1 drill where the one (my husband or i) hit the ball down the middle and they have to call it and execute a hit, back hand and fore hand for each side, a small volley into a slam, serving (obviously), and score keeping. I'm having a hard time getting them into drop shots and moving up to the net, though. Majority of our students are 55+, we have never had any in their 20-30 range. 

I understand that mobility may be an issue for some of the students, but how can I encourage them to move up to the kitchen after the initial first few hits?

68,Pickleball,Settle a debate* for me (*with myself): Do I buy the Paddletek Bantam TS-5 or the Engage Poach Advantage?,"I work for a Pickleball company, so I've been lucky enough to be able to try tons of different paddles, across different brands and price ranges. The kicker is, I'm brand new to the sport (I'm a tennis convert) and I am unsure of what it is that I personally need for my play style--or lack thereof. 

The two I've played best with so far are the Bantam TS-5 and Poach Advantage. I am leaning towards the Bantam, as I naturally play better with it, it's so light (I think I played with a 6.9) that I get virtually no fatigue in my arm, and I really enjoy the ball feel.

The reason I'm considering the Poach is because it has a bigger face and larger sweet spot, and it seems to have more ""kick"" to it so I don't have to swing as hard, probably due to the weight (I think it was a 7.6 or 7.8, which is light for this paddle). The downside is that it's heavier and tires my arm/wrist out a bit and I don't play quite as well with it naturally.

The reason I'm asking here is because I'm wondering if I should go with the paddle that has the larger face/sweetspot and will likely be more forgiving as a beginner, banking on strengthening my arm and playing better with it over time, or if I should go with the paddle that already feels kinda like an extension of my own arm even if I've gotta swing a little harder from time to time to get it over the net?

20,Pickleball,A different PB club!,"Every PB venue I‚Äôve visited is structured the same way. Separate according to skill level, tell less skilled players how to play, and primary focus is ‚Äúget better at PB‚Äù. 

I did not like the smug PB stars at the local community club so I started my own group at the YMCA. Now Everyone plays together. Everyone smiles and laughs. Non competitive. We get little old ladies even that get pretty good and you can see in their eyes the memories of younger days as they play and relive that athletic prowess. They would not last long in most PB clubs. I personally learned so much about sportsmanship. I used to get too ‚Äúwound up‚Äù and wanted to win. Now after I play a few hours in my club I honestly cannot remember if I lost or won. 

Once and a while we get a visitor who tells us we are doing it wrong but we smile and nod while they usually beat the crap out of us on the court then find somewhere else to play. Many of my players like to play back (the cardinal sin of PB) most of our players whack it. Not many dink. But everyone has fun. I hardly ever saw smiling at the other club. ",1542945497
21,Pickleball,Follow-through tips?,"Hey guys, I started playing Pickleball just a month ago. Apparently from what the other players say I have very good raw skills. I get to basically every ball even if it's not near me; my serve is decent and sometimes really good; apparently I even spin the ball really good without noticing; and my net game seems to be good too. But everyone says I have no follow-through. I know that means pushing the paddle after making contact with it, but for some reason, as soon as I make contact (hard or soft) I stop mid stroke.

Is there any way other than being very self conscious of my swings to get used to this follow-through? Or do I just need more hours/weeks/months of playing to get the hang of it? I want to follow-through, but again, as soon as I hit the ball with my paddle, for some reason I stop swinging. ",1542396075

51,Pickleball,Why we play,"	 I just read an article on Facebook in which the writer wanted to know if, in a pickleball tournament situation, it is considered poor sportsmanship to attack the weaker player of a doubles team. I think the answer depends on why you play the game.  I see two groups of people who play pickleball and will admit that it is possible, but difficult, to be a member of both groups.    Group One I will call the Socials. This group plays for the exercise and the fun of the game. They like to play with  partners of different ability  levels and are generally more tolerant of newbie players. Their main interest is  in prolonging a rally and if they win the point that's fine but they are not disappointed if it goes against them. They are motivated to improve their techniques in order to have more fun playing not necessarily to win more games.  They would rather lose 15 to 13 than win 11 to 1. Generally, they will not concentrate their fire on a weak player and often try to ‚Äúease up‚Äù a bit and give the weaker player an opportunity to hit the ball rather than take the kill shot. They feel bad if their hard overhead smash shot strikes their opponent despite the fact that getting hit with a pickleball rarely causes any physical damage. They seem to enjoy the time chatting between matches as long as it is not to prolonged. Tournaments are of little interest to them. Overall, the interest is in the play of the game not wins.  Group Two I will call the Competitors.  They also play for the exercise and the fun of the game but with a bit more emphasis on scoring points. They are most comfortable playing with equals or more proficient players and don't enjoy playing with or against newbies.  Rallies are nice but winning the point is important. They are motivated to improve so they can progress up to playing even stronger players and do well in tournaments. Chatting is fine as long as it is a deconstruction the  most recent game or discussing new Pickleball techniques. Their game is a much more aggressive and they can't help exploiting a weakness in their opponent. The overhead smash that hits the opponent in the chest is a good shot and they feel that getting hit with a pickleball shot is more embarrassing than dangerous.  The Competitors seek out tournaments and try to find partners that improve their chances of advancing.  Is one group better than the other? Certainly not, there is room in this game for both groups. They all love the game but for different reasons. To the Socials concentrating on deliberately hitting at a weak player is not part of their game but they usually understand that it is a necessity in tournament play. The Competitors recognize they need to tone down when playing with Socials but it is difficult for them to do so.  Can these groups interact? It is beneficial for the Socials to play with the more experienced people occasionally; it is a good way to improve their game. The Competitors benefit  by playing with the less experienced people and helping the them to elevate their play, thus creating a larger pool of players for them to compete with. We were all newbies at one time.  It is a rare person who can participate in both groups comfortably, but they do exist; it is a great pleasure to play with or against them.

9,Pickleball,Pickleball Tutor vs. Simon 2.0 Ball Throwing Machines.,"Hi! fellow Redditors and Pickleballers.  Anyone have any experience with both of these machines?  I'm considering buying one but can't decide which is the best value for my money.  The Tutor is more expensive but has some nice advantages, portability, oscillation, higher ball speed.  The Simon seems to be a well built  machine, lower cost, higher volume ball hopper, high lob. I've read many positive reviews about both and some negative point, the Tutor is at time troublesome to adjust, short battery time and throwing wheels loosing traction.  I really haven't read anything negative about the Simon, but the size, lower throwing speed and no oscillation, to be consideration.  I'm not sure how much weight to put to these pros and cons. I'm purchasing mainly for myself to improve my game, but I'll also rent the machine to some friends who put on training sessions. I'm hoping some of you have experience with both machines and can give me some  guidance and wisdom on this matter. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.",1516762277
10,Pickleball,Ben Johns and Christine Mcgrath clinic breakdown.,"As I had mentioned on a previous post I recently participated in a clinic with [Ben and Christine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWKpDJfjCaU).  The clinic was primarily drill based with the coaches providing individual tips as they walked through the courts.  Here is what we did:

1.  The first drill was the cross-court dink drill.  They emphasized footwork to get yourself in position for every and being able to shift back to center. They also stressed not to get into straight cross-court dinking battles, but to mix it up with some dinks straight cross-court and some played to center.

2.  The second drill built upon the first. One player would hit the cross-court, the next would go line.  Repeat. This was to widen the arsenal and give more options in dink battles.

3.  The third drill was block shots.  You and a partner would line up at the kitchen line.  One player would feed harder shots to their drill partner who would attempt to block the shot to the feeders feet.  The big takeaway was to plant, keep the paddle vertical at 11-12 o'clock in front of you, keep the paddle face open, and not to swing.  

4.  The fourth drill was essentially a 5th shot drill. Like the previous, a feeder from the kitchen line would hit shots to their drill partner in no-man's land.  This player would attempt to block or hit a soft dropshot that could get them to the net.  They did say that the fifth shot should always be a drop, not a drive.

5.  For the fifth drill, we played a game called dingles.  It started like the cross-court dink drill.  Four players would cross court dink to each other. Whenever one of the balls was hit into the net or out someone would yell ""dingles"" and you would play the point out with anything fair game.  This drill was fun and created some interesting points.

6.  The last drill was the classic dropshot drill.  Players line up across from each other and hit drops.  One works their way back to the baseline and then back to the kitchen and then the other does the same.  For dropshots, they emphasized positioning, hitting drops with a closed stance, and trying to take them from the same body positioning.  

Some of my takeaways: 
Even though most of these drills I have done before, it was valuable to me to hear tips from an outside perspective.  It made me evaluate some of my mechanics and gave me some tools to remedy my weaker shots (especially those mid-court 5th shot drops).  Most of us don't specifically think about our mechanics or body positioning when we drill.  For myself I will try and be more cognizant of this in the future.  

The biggest takeaway, however, I think came in pickup points that we played after the clinic itself. Both Ben and Christine are phenomenal players.  It was amazing to see them in action, truly next level.  What I really noticed was how they positioned themselves for every shot.  The footwork set everything up.  They didn't take many off-balance shots unless they absolutely had too.  Their dropshot were amazingly consistent because they got to the right spot and hit it with the same mechanics every time.  They were rarely in awkward spots, all setup by their feet.  

All in all, a solid experience. My goal is to reach 4.5 this year.  I'm sure the knowledge I gained will help. ",1516050799

31,Pickleball,Knuckleball update.,"I had posted a couple of months ago about wanting to learn a knuckleball serve.  I figured out how to do it, but I don't know that it's strictly legal.  I can stop the spin by hitting the ball and keeping my wrist perfectly still.  But I think that puts my wrist too far in front, if I'm getting an upward trajectory.  I know the ""legal/illegal serve"" conversation isn't lacking for traction, but I'm interested in the community's take.  ",1509814988
32,Pickleball,Why is there a lack of 18-40 year old players?,"I have only been playing pickleball for 3 months so I'm definitely still a beginner. I am 27 years old for context. I have been playing with a few different groups and only happened upon the sport because I saw people playing when I was walking my dog. I honestly wasn't aware of the sport at all. 

I love pickleball and feel like it is a perfect match for me as a sport. I feel like I had to fight to be included in these groups, because I had to ask after playing for a month to be included on an email list that I didn't even know existed when I first started playing. I want this sport to grow, and people always talk about wanting to get younger players out there. It just seems like no one is actively pursuing this.

The first group I played with seemed very exclusive, and I was referred to as the young guy, or kid a lot. I understand it, but it is  frustrating to feel like the odd person out in a group when everyone has the same common interest in pickleball. The second group I started playing with is much more inviting and inclusive, but I am still the young guy by far. 

I understand the nature of this sport, and I understand that it is attractive to an older audience. It is just frustrating that I never see another person within 10 years of my age out there playing. I tell my friends about it and they think its funny that I play because to them pickleball is only for old people, which is the whole perception that I would like to see shifted. 

I am by no means saying that I don't want to play with people of all ages. I am just frustrated that it isn't really people of all ages. I am playing exclusively with people who are 40 or older. I feel like most of my frustration would be solved by having an advanced skill group that plays separately from the other groups, but there aren't enough people playing in my area for that to be possible.",1509300565

36,Pickleball,Beginner vs Advanced paddles,"When I started playing, I bought a Champion set, so my wife and I could jump in and start playing.  After a few months, I tried some paddles at our club and bought a Gamma Micron. I really liked it, but it eventually just felt ""dead"". I figured it was time to move up, since I wasn't a novice any more, and bought an Ultimate, since it had similar specs as the Micron. I haven't ever been that happy with it, so now I'm looking at the new Gamma Mirage, again because it has similar specs to the Micron. Why is the Micron considered an ""entry level"" paddle, but these others aren't?  What advantage is there to an ""advanced"" paddle?  I suppose the best advice is ""use it if you like it"", but if I can gain an advantage with a different paddle, I'd like to take it. ",1508343166

I'm not normally this vain about sporting equipment, but these are just laughably bad.  I can't see myself owning anything that an 8 year old with MS paint designed.  I get that sweat shops are a thing, but a little subtly goes a long way.

Does anyone have links to paddles that don't look like I'm trying to ride it to the moon?  I'm a beginner so I don't need strong performance.  I just can't force myself to buy a swinging advertisement on PCP.

-- Gorilla tape (someone said they did this on a review on PickleballCentral's product listing for this paddle)

-- brushed-on liquid epoxy resin

-- some kind of sprayed-on resin or plastic coat (obviously with the paddle face taped off for protection when doing so)

-- Sugru

Entered a tournament as a 4.0. Ended up not having tons of entrants so we played a men's open round robin. Tons of fun, but also meant playing with players significantly above the 4.0 level. 

The first video is a pure butt whopping put on by a few heavily decorated veterans Steve Paranto and Randy Bither. They're play is pretty phenomenal and makes me recognize I've got a long way to go. 

https://youtu.be/06CDoOsXUWM

The second video is a bit more of an evenly matched game.

91,Pickleball,Ambassadorship and thoughts on growing this sub.,"As many of you have figured out by now I am all-in with pickleball.  I recently received my final approval and am now an official USAPA Ambassador for the sport.  I applied for ambassadorship with thought beyond expanding the sport in the Denver/metro where I live.  One of the things I would like to do is to help r/pickleball grow and be a strong online community for those who enjoy this sport.  Here is where you come in.  I would like to solicit your ideas/opinions on how we can help grow and curate pickleball in the digital realm.  

I absolutely realize the unique spot pickleball is in.  The age ranges of regular players are more polarized than any other sport that I can think of.  I also understand that a good chunk of the player base is over 65 and less inclined to participate in online social/news aggregators like reddit.  That being said, I also think that there is a future for pickleball in the online realm and that r/pickleball can be in the vanguard for providing a platform for players, strategy discussion, links to places to play, a marketplace for used gear,  and the myriad of other topics relevant to pickleball.  

I encourage any/all of you to contribute, lurkers and regular posters alike.  Once again, if any of you have any CSS experience or know someone who might be willing to help us, please PM me.  I'd love to start adding some more content to the sidebar, but lack the technical expertise to do so.  Thanks again for your time, r/pickleball.  Hope to see you on the courts.

12,Pickleball,Thoughts on the new Paddletek P7 Outdoor Ball?,"Hey everyone,


Checking in to see if anyone has tried the new Paddletek P7 Outdoor Ball? I got a few of these for free while purchasing a paddle and have only hit around with them a very small amount due to getting ready for a tournament playing with the Onix Pure 2. 


However, they certainly seem like an intriguing ball. Here are some of my initial thoughts:

* **Heavy -** Just like the Dura40 this ball is heavy and tends to descend quicker and bounce less than your typical ball. 


* **Soft -** Unlike the Dura40 and more like the Onix Pure 2 this ball is softer which makes boxing and touch players in the kitchen very strong. I have a buddy that despises the Dura40 because of the ""lack of control""(I call it lack of practice) he has with the ball in the kitchen, but he loves this ball, that I believe travels very much like the Dura40, but plays more like the Onix Pure 2 in the kitchen.


* **Fast -** This ball plays FAST. Like the Dura40 it was almost hard for my mind to catch up after playing with the Onix Pure 2 so much lately. I found myself getting behind the ball especially in the kitchen with how much pace you could put on it. 


These are my only thoughts so far on the ball with the limited play I've had with it. The real things that I'm wondering about is; **What is the durability and life of the ball after extended hours of play?** and **How does it hold up in different climates, hot/cold?**(Being from a 4 season state). 


It seems like a really cool ball and I'm excited to test it more after my January tournament!

28,Pickleball,Some drills to help your game improve!,"Hey everyone! I am always looking at this sub and noticed that there is not much of an educational or ways to improve content on this page. I wanted to let you all in some of the key drills that have really worked to help my doubles partner and I progress from beginner, intermediate, and to what some would call advance play. 

**Third Shot Drop Shot**

* You will be standing back at the baseline while you partner stands at the kitchen line. Your partner feeds you the ball and you practice dropping each shot back in the kitchen. *Note - If you don't have a partner to practice with, try bringing a bucket or a small cardboard box to place in the kitchen, bouncing the ball in front of you from the baseline, and try shooting the ball into the kitchen. This not only helps your third shot drop, but also the accuracy of your shot.*


**Third Shot Drill**

* Once you have your third shot down it is time to ramp it up a little bit. Both you and your partner start at the baseline. You serve the ball to your partner, they return, and move up to the net. You must then perform a third shot drop without them killing the ball back to you. You can practice this from straight on and/or across from each other. *Note - If you are competitive like myself, you and your partner can play if the ball land inside the kitchen you get a point. First to 11 wins!*


**Fifth Shot Drill**

* Once you have beat your partner to a pulp in the third shot drill, it's time to ramp it up even more! You and your partner start at the baseline. You serve to your partner, they return, and you perform a third shot. This time instead of calling the ball dead, your partner gives you a return shot and you must place the ball back(on your fifth shot) into the kitchen. 


**Fifth Shot Drill** *Continuous*

* You do everything the same as the drill above, but your partner tries to keep you back off the line. You must then work your way all the way to the kitchen line. If you want to play out the remainder of the point from the kitchen line you can, but your first objective is to get up there. 


**Mid Court Volley**

* This is getting up in level of play, but is an important skill to have when trying to move up to the kitchen line. Your partner stands at the kitchen line and you stand around mid court or *No man's land*. Your partner then feeds you the ball around knee/waist/chest height. You then work on taking the ball out of the air and volley it back into the kitchen. 


**Fifth Shot with Walk Back**

* Again, for more advance players.You do the fifth shot drill and once you make it up to the kitchen line you begin to slowly move backwards all the way to the baseline while continuing to make your shots into the kitchen. 


**Fifth Shot with Lob**

* This is getting up there in skill, so take your time getting to this drill. You do the fifth shot drill and once you are up at the kitchen you lob your partner to the baseline, they run back, return the lob, and then proceed to work their way back up to the kitchen. 


**PLEASE NOTICE AT THIS POINT IS ONLY DRILLS TO MAKE IT UP TO THE KITCHEN LINE. THIS IS THE MOST DOMINANT POSITION IN PICKLEBALL AND AN IMPORTANT SKILL TO MASTER**


**Dink Count**

* This is a simple drill where you and your partner dink in the kitchen as many times as possible while counting. Start straight across from each other and work your way up to be able to do cross court dinking. Try from different positions around the court and do your best to beat your score each time!


**Dink Around the Kitchen**

* You and your partner start straight across from each other and slowly move sideways down the court while dinking the ball from one end to the other. Once you are able to move all the way to the other side of the court, try to come back! Great to work footwork around the kitchen line.


**Dink Count with Movement**

* This requires you to be able to dink cross court on both your forehand and backhand side. You do the Dink Count drill, but after 10 or 20 hits, either you or your partner quickly move to the other side of the court. This is to practice court movement, being able changing ball locations quickly, and focus on ball placement. 


**Tethering**

 * This skill is key for successful teams in Pickleball. Act like you and your partner have a string attached at the ankle and where ever they go, you go. You and your partner should only have 6'' to 1' between each other's wingspan at any moment. This skill helps you effectively cover the entire court without leaving holes on the court for your opponents to score. The easiest way to practice this is to get 4 people and do the Dink Count drill and focus on spacing between you and your partner. 


**Kitchen Volley**

* This is an easy skill to practice, but a hard skill to master. Do the Dink Count drill and let your partner drive some shots down to your feet. Practice reaching out into the kitchen and taking the volley in the air and placing it back into the kitchen before they get to your feet. 


**Drop Shots/Blocking**

* Have a hard time against people that bang the ball from the baseline or close to the net? Prevent it! Step 1 is to remember to always keep your paddle up in front of you. Step 2 is learning how to deaden their shot and put it right back in the kitchen. You stand at the kitchen line while your partner stands at the baseline. Have your partner drive a hard, flat shot into your mid section. Practice blocking the ball and putting it back into the kitchen. 


**Attacking/Fast Game**

* You and your partner start at mid court and begin to volley the ball. Keep the ball in the air and slowly move up to the kitchen line continuing to volley the ball. Once you are established, practice attacking and blocking while keeping the ball in the air. Some key things to remember is to keep your paddle out in front of you, keep the ball flat or moving downhill, and don't retreat from the line once you are established to give your partners a better angel to attack you. 


**Reseting the Point**

* An important part of the fast game is realizing when you are losing it. You start off the same way as the attacking/fast game drill, but after 5 quick exchanges, no matter where the ball is, you must try to block and reset the point back into the kitchen. Use this skill when the other team has the downward angel while attacking you. 

**Jump Around the Kitchen Kill Shot Drill**

* For Advance Players. There is a technical name for this shot that I can not remember at this time. Begin dinking with your partner and have them hit a shot back over the high part of the net. Practice footwork jumping around the kitchen without faulting for the kill shot. This skill is important to have presence of the court and to change the pace of the game. 


**Around the Post Shot**

* For Advance Players. Just as in Ping Pong, when you are sent out wide, the ball doesn't have to go over the net. Your partner stands close to the net and throws or feeds a ball out wide past the post. You stand at the kitchen line, follow the ball out wide, and drive the ball back into the court. *Note - It is important to let the ball drop to it's lowest point before striking the ball.*


**Defending the Around the Post Shot**

* For Advance Players. Your partner stands on the outside of the court and strikes the ball as if going around the net. You follow them outside of the court and block/volley the ball back into the kitchen. 


I'm sure there are plenty more drills and feel free to post them here! These are just a few that my partner and I have been practicing to improve our game that I wanted to pass along with the rest of you. Enjoy!!

35,Pickleball,"New player, grip circumference question","**(tl;dr : new player, which paddle do I order? etc)**

Hey yall,

I'm working on being less sedentary and getting a modicum of fitness.  Raw exercise is really boring and most sports don't engage me.  I've been down to the local pickleball court now a couple of times and borrowed spare paddles.  I think this could be what I'm looking for.  I think it's time to buy my first paddle.

##Main Question##

I've been looking at information regarding paddles online.  I've always thought of my hands as medium/large (male), certainly not huge.  An online sizing chart I printed out puts my ideal grip at 4.5"" (large).  Using random objects at home, I found a 4.5"" aspirin bottle that let me test the off-hand-finger sizing trick. (not real accurate, sure, but it's all I've got; the ring-finger palm-crease method tells me 5.25 -- I've got to be doing that wrong.)  There's only one local store that has a small selection of non-wood paddles, and half of them are packaged to prevent holding their grips.  All but one had 4"" grips.  The 4 1/8"" grip felt subtly better.  

I think I'll order online, but I still haven't gotten a good feel for what grip to order.  Do I order a 4.25, or one of the very few 4.5s?  How well do grip tapes work for bulking a grip?  Can you even go from 4.25 to 4.5 with grip tape?  Do they subtract from the feel and control of the grip?  Am I overthinking this and should just settle with any old 4""?  Why do they sell so many paddles with 4"" grips?

##Related Questions##

It's been about a decade since I've enjoyed low-skill badminton, some of which is translating to pickleball.  My guess is that I want a medium/slightly-light weight paddle, high elasticity (pop?), and a full length grip.  With at least one paddle, I kept hitting the top of the net (underestimating the give of the paddle).  Because I'm so new, I'm not sure how my game will adjust and progress over time.  Maybe I only think I want those things?

Because I haven't been able to try a wide selection of paddles on court, I'm having a hard time gauging the different cores and faces.  Also, because I don't have a lot of cash, and because I might not make a great purchase the first time, I'm curious about used paddles and factory seconds (from reputable sites).  Are those as safe as they seem?  Speaking of which, are there sites that are particularly recommended, or should be avoided?  

Anything else that I should have asked, but didn't?

The owner of our pickleball center used to live and play in Hawaii.  He said Hawaiians call it ""Pukaball"".  ""Puka"" means ""hole"".  (puka shells have holes?  not sure about that one)  I think it's a great description of the ball and separates it from whiffleball, which is essentially plastic baseball.

1. The non-volley zone. So you can stand in there, but you cannot hit a ball while you are in there, right?  I seem to remember reading something that if a ball lands in the non-volley zone, you are then allowed to hit a ball while you are in the non-volley zone but that is the only exception.  Is this right?

2. If a ball touches the top of the net, but still continues on and land in a fair zone of the court, is it considered a fault or is this ok?  This happened several times the last time I played and it seems unfair if you are on the receiving end of it.

3.  Can someone explain which side of the court you are supposed to serve on for whatever point?  I only play singles right now so that is the only rules I am interested in knowing.

54,Pickleball,Give your thoughts on the new Onix Pure 2,"I just wanted to get thoughts on the ball that seems to be sweeping the nation, the Onix Pure 2. It was recently approved by the USAPA for sanctioned tournament play, (http://ipickleball.org/rules/List%20of%20Approved%20Balls.pdf), and some tournaments have made the quick switch from the Dura Fast 40 to the Onix Pure 2. 


A couple of questions people in my area have are as followed:

* **Do you notice a difference in play between the Onix Pure 1 and Onix Pure 2?** The ball is supposed to bounce less to not favor power hitters, but people in my area are having a hard time distinguishing the two.

* **Are more tournaments going to be switching to the Onix Pure 2 instead of the Dura Fast 40?** I have people in my area that are going to some USAPA sanctioned tournaments that have already made the switch and people are wondering if this is the end of the road for the Dura Fast 40.

* **What are the implications and differences from moving away from the Dura Fast 40 to the Onix Pure 2?** Was the Dura Fast 40 really moving too ""Fast"" as the name suggests with the new paddles that are coming out? How will this effect younger or older players?




These are just some of the slew of questions I have been getting in my area. Would love to know others thoughts!

56,Pickleball,Sidebar and CSS help,"Hey all, I jumped on as a mod because I wanted to add a few changes to the r/pickleball sub.  I think that we could add useful links like: USAPA home page, Pickleball Tournaments homepage, u/gigman1 linked the approved ball list in a comment and I think that would be handy as well.  But perhaps the most useful info we could provide is a list of places to play.  I would love for us to be able to consolidate this broken down by city/state.  My problem: I don't know jack about CSS nor have my diggings provide me any answers.  I don't know what I don't know about these stylizations.  Do any of you have any experience with sub stylings that might be able to provide assistance?  This sub has grown about 100% in a little more than a year.  I think the more content we can provide will help the sub as pickleball continues to become more popular.

59,Pickleball,State of the meta-game,"I played out-of-state this last week in Albuquerque and took a few games to get acclimated.  I play at the 4.0 level with a crew that ranges from 4.0-5.0 in the Denver Metro and most of the players in the circles I inhabit play the touch game.  Most third shots will be drops, there are at least a few rallies per game that will go over half-a-dozen dinks.  In Albq. I saw 5 dinks in 7 games.  They were all solid players, but they were bangers.  I watch a lot of 5.0 play and it seems like both strategies are viable.  There are some top-tier players that always seem to rip that 3rd and are more likely to blast a shot than dink. What do you think, r/pickleball?  Is the faster game the future?  Do you like playing the softer touch game or do you like ripping it?  Some combo of both?  ",1469588812

When I approached this with my plans for bringing the sport here to Taiwan, he was very optimistic and he himself had plans to continue with the sport after his retirement. 
He has since offered me equipment to use including balls and paddles both of which are difficult to come by in a country which has never heard of the sport. I'd say this is a positive start.
There are big plans ahead and many steps to take. Pickleball should be a perfect fit into a country that loves its ping pong and badminton. Here's hoping!

I'm looking for any advice on where to start. Of course I have experience with the sport but doing it in a second language will be interesting as my Chinese is mediocre. Where would you start? 

In advance, any feedback is appreciated!

97,Pickleball,"""Just hit it to Player 2"" Frustration","Last night I was at a rec-center open play and playing against a middle-aged guy who I've played with/against a handful of times. He tends to take the game somewhat seriously and is always trying to get better. I appreciate that. 

I noticed that in game 1 he huddled up with his partner, a nice older man, and from then on they hit 95% of their shots to my partner, Player 2. This player is fundamentally strong but maybe not a ""big shot"" threat. 

These people love the dink game so every rally goes to 7, 8, 9 hits. So by the middle of game 1, my partner has hit 70 or so shots and I've hit a handful. 

I'm ice cold. The pattern becomes that I stand there like a scarecrow for a few minutes then a shot comes my way and I either hit a mediocre shot or error. I have no rhythm at all. 

Normally this wouldn't bother me, but we decided to play 3 games. Typically we would finish and find new opponents and I would forget about it. 

So what can a person do? My opponents were playing a sound strategy. Hit it to the less threatening player and keep their partner cold. 

Should I back off of the line and create a big irresistible gap so that they are more likely to involve me in the game? Is this just a flaw in the game?

4,Pickleball,Informal Pickleball Quiz,"I got called out the other day by one of my buddies who says I complain too much on indoor/outdoor, paddles, ball type, bangers vs. touch game play, playing with novice players.  My response was that I am looking for a certain type of game and play.  I prefer outdoor play vs. indoor because of the pace of the game.  When outdoor I like the Onix PURE ball as it has a great soft touch and isn't as fragile as most of the outdoor balls I have played with.  I use a Paddletek Tempset because it is a great touch paddle that is well suited for dropshots and the short game.  I will play with more novice players (and did so this very morning) but I don't enjoy those games as much as they: 1. force me to play non-optimal strategy having to adjust my game when my partner bangs as opposed to trying to play net and 2.  deal with the fact that they hit to me only 20% of the time.  In essence, I am kinda picky about the game because the more I play the more I realize that consistency will help it grow.  I think it is strange that you can play one tournament with a certain type of ball and and something completely different elsewhere and that is just one example.  So, ranting aside, here are my questions for you, r/pickleball.

1.  What skill level do you play?

2.  Do you prefer indoor or outdoor play and why?

3.  What is your goto paddle?

4.  What is your preferred ball?

5.  What is one change that you think might make the sport better?

My number 5 suggestion (which I am stealing from The Pickleball Show Podcast).  Make tourney play (at least at the 5.0 level, and i'm definitely not there yet) 3 game matches.

42,Pickleball,My Year in Pickleball,"It was February when my buddy Nick said, ""Let's go play some pickleball.""  As I am sure at least a few of you felt, I was apprehensive at first.  I had at points in my life played tennis, racquetball, and table tennis at some sort of competitive level, but...pickleball?  Well, first of all, the name is terrible.  Who wants to go play a sport called pickleball?  Nick was persistent, however , and eventually I relented.  I got on the court and looked around.  I was one of the younger people there by probably a good 20 years.  What was I getting myself into?  And then the game began.  Those two hours flew by as fast as any I have had.  Nick and I were at the very next session.  And the next.  This...pickleball.   It was amazing!  
    
The lure was strong.  I found myself playing at least three times a week.  I searched for videos on YouTube.  I found this, admittedly dead, subreddit.  I quickly outgrew my humble gym primarily frequented by casual players and retirees just looking to kill a few hours a couple days a week.  I journeyed to every corner of my city looking for the good games.  I saw an advanced session on Sunday mornings that I muscled my way into even if my skill level was not commiserate.  I played, and played, and played.  

Today I played my last tournament of the year and won advanced doubles with my partner.  It has been an amazing year so far.  I lost 50 pounds playing pickleball.  I have four 1st place finishes in 5 tournaments)[http://imgur.com/fPNdUXA).  I started from not knowing what this sport is 10 months ago to playing at a competent 4.0 level.  Last week I went to Vegas and wasn't as excited about hitting the poker tables (and I love me some poker) as playing outdoor.  

So here I am today, limbs sore from 7 hours of tournament play and writing this to the few people on this planet that know the joy this sport gives me.  As many of you know from my frequent postings: I love this sport.  As it grows I will take pride in knowing that I was one of the curators at the beginning of pickleball's explosion.  As u/Doublebounce pointed out in their eloquent musings on the sport turning 50: who knows what the future holds?  I certainly don't but I do hope I can be a part of it.  I wish you all a fantastic holiday and a wonderful new year.  I hope that 2016 brings you happiness on and off the court.  And if you find yourself in Denver and are ever looking for a game know that there is at least one player that can show you around.  Happy Holidays r/Pickleball!

67,Pickleball,Tell us about the Pickleball scene in your area.,"Hey r/pickleball, as you probably have gleaned from my other posts I play out of Denver.  The scene out here is pretty solid.  There are over [50 courts and rec centers](http://www.pickleballken.org/wpscripts/facilities.html) where pickleball is played weekly with a good variety in skill level and age.  In the suburb of Arvada, a bit northwest of Denver, we have the recently built Apex Outdoor Pickleball courts that is a 24-court, lit, dedicated pickleball facility.  Weekends it will have 3-4 courts of 4.0+ play with the rest a mix of casual and competitive players.  It is consistently packed.  
My home courts are in the heart of the Denver metro at a place called Congress Park.  This park has 4 junior tennis courts that have been relined for pickleball.  I play there weekly and haven't had a single instance where there were more players on the 8 tennis courts than on the pickleball.  We are hoping to petition Denver Parks and rec to convert another tennis court to pickleball (all of the tennis courts are under lights, but the junior courts are not.)  I am not looking forward to the return to indoors once the snow starts falling but that is par for the course in Denver.  Would love to hear about the scene in your area.",1443385963

Happy Birthday 50th Pickleball , Learn from from history

 Born in the summer of 1965, pickleball turns 50 this year. Happy Birthday!
Sports do some interesting things around the age of 50. I would argue that it‚Äôs really when the third generation of athletes play the game. For some perspective let me mention what happened to other sports at this age;
Football, due to deaths and popularity was commissioned by the President to change drastically.  The Forward Pass was made legal and the game has become the most popular in America.

Baseball, established a world series, and set the game on a stage for the best known athlete of the century, Babe Ruth. Skyrocketing with the invention of Radio as a means to broadcast this ‚ÄúBabe‚Äù, a larger than life image.

Tennis is maybe the most interesting. Although  it was played for hundreds, possibly in some form, thousands of years. But once the Rubber bouncy ball was created in mass by Mr. Goodyear, the game was played by the common man overnight. Within 50 years top athletes began to  play the game, not just the elite. Then the majors were formed as well as The Davis cup. It would not be long until neighborhoods throughout the USA had Tennis  courts. 

So what  do I think Pickleball can learn from History; 

As baseball had the radio, you have the internet. And so far I truly believe that the seniors, who may have gone out of their comfort zone at first , have used the internet to expose youth players to coaching and the solid fundamentals. I really respect what this generation has done for the game. This should be encourage to the highest degree possible.

At some point, someone will figure out something about the game that makes it more advantageous to an athlete with superior ability. It will be resisted at first, the same players that have played the same way for so long will not like it. But it may bring the marquee athletes into the game.  Is a softball windmill type serve? maybe something to do with no volley-line? Maybe large cash prizes?  I just know that if you currently care about the game, you will probably not embrace it at first, unless its the cash. Then you probably want that, but just remember it took football almost 100 years to completely  embrace the forward pass.



But this next, third generation, is so unique. These players will be both 30 -50, as well as 0-12 creating the potential for the largest group coming to the game at one time.  Thanks to the effort of senior players, or the ‚Äúfirst generation‚Äù,  courts are beginning to get  built specifically for pickleball, Middle School and High School curriculums are adding this game, tournaments are popping up all over the country, there is even  a national championship. I used to order paddles from some retired air force member how somehow flattened airplane parts ( I never really understood this process), now you can buy a paddle at sporting good stores, but more than likely you shop at one of the  hundreds of online stores, and you have dozens of options. In 2007, if I wanted to go to a tournament, the only one on I could find within a 12 hour drive was at a nudist campground. This year there were 8 within a 2 hour drive. 


But what does it mean for pickleball?  It should continue to bloom. My advice would be to keep doing what you do, continue reaching out using the social media. Reach to the younger side of the game, embrace the 30-50 that will be coming.  Be open to the changes that may come and when your larger than life players comes around, be ready  to learn.  Be prepared for the next group coming in, you will recognize them when they say, ‚ÄúWhy do you call it Pickleball.?

76,Pickleball,Parks department finally draw Pickleball lines.,"So my local parks department has said for the past few months that they are going to make a small hardly used tennis court in a small deserted park more Pickleball friendly....

So they finally paint lines, in the largest busiest park in town and will only provide nets when the senior center is open. So for a mid-thirty employed Pickleballer I either continue to draw my own lines in peace or wait for sweaty shirtless teenage boys to finish tennis practice. 

Sorry for the rant here, anyone face similar obstacles in playing this awesome sport?  ",1439638281

However, finding a place to play around Hilliard has been difficult as well as securing a net and correct court lines to really play the game. Anyone have some DIY tips on portable nets/lines? I have been telling everyone I know about it and am trying to get a younger crowd into it here in C-Bus. But need more than a sad tennis court in Hilliard to lob balls across the too high net.

For me..

I live in Mount Vernon, Ohio and play 2-3 days a weeks for 2-3 hours at a time.  On average we have 8-12 of us that play so it makes for nice changes in play due to everyone has their own style and skill level. Besides myself and my gf (we're both 30) the average age of the players tends to be in the mid 40s, though they are all extremely athletic and most are former tennis or racquetball players.  Very fast paced and intense games usually.  We are fortunate to have both indoor and outdoor places to play so it's a year long sport.",1421955362

As I am getting more addicted to this sport, I can help to look at the mainly used strategy of the game is to play dink shots and a lot of patience. But I would like to see this game add more elements use in modern tennis.  Evolve like tennis did from serve and volley to baseline play. Might make it more interesting.",1355986015
