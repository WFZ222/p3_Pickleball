29,pickleball,"psa: newer players, if you can afford a pickleball throwing machine, it will massively shorten the learning curve","hey, guy i'm a brand new player (hit my first ever ball last monday) with several year of other racket sport rattling around in my brain from 25+ year ago. i knew i wa going to love this sport, so i bought a decent machine before i even took a beginner clinic last monday. monday after the clinic and tuesday, i took out the robot and hit probably 1000 ball total, mostly dink and third shot drops, plus just enough serve return to get them consistently deep. wednesday, i wa immediately competitive with the intermediate crowd at the club i joined - these are 2.0 to 3.0 type folks. that's not to brag that i'm awesome, but to say that the ability to hit 500 specific shot in under 90 minute is a massive advantage in learning this game. i could not be more pleased with how well the robot work and how well the shot i drill with it translate to game situations. the available machine are the pickleball tutor line from \~$800 and up ([)). any of those should get you started but you'll definitely want the oscillation feature on any that don't have it by default. topspin/backspin will be necessary eventually, but maybe not essential to start out. you don't need 2-line oscillation or a (stupidly expensive) remote. you turn off the machine, fill the hopper, start the machine, walk around the net and hit until empty... after setting up the drill at the beginning of the first hopper full by tweaking speed/spin/angle until it's shooting where you want, which usually take just 10 ball or so. in order to make sure you're spending more time hitting ball than collecting them, the fastest ball pickup option will be a ""jumbo dustpan"" like this: [). it work great. do not bother with those stupid tube collectors, and i don't see how the kollectaball roller device could be any faster than the jumbo bin and 6 time the cost, especially most of the ball will be up against a wall where the roller will suck. i can refill the lobster (\~120 ball capacity) in under 5 minutes. with a comfortable 8-second ball interval, it take around 15 minute to empty, so your ratio of drilling to busywork is quite high. happy hitting, y'all.",1636749645

128,pickleball,how the dink's picklepod stack up against other pickleball podcasts,"**disclaimer:** picklepod is doing a dink swag giveaway -- you write a review on the apple podcast site and one on social medium (facebook or reddit) and receive a top and hat when they come out with new merch. *i think that's why you're seeing a few post pop up in the subreddit.* i'd say i welcome the traffic, but most of the ""reviews"" have been excessively shallow. i'm going to offer my thought and go just a *tad* deeper (wall of text warning -- tl;dr at bottom). i'd like to talk about the various pickleball podcasts, what they offer, and give thought a to why a podcast for a sport is even important. first up, let's look at the biggest pickleball podcasts out there: * [pickleball kitchen podcast with barrett kincheloe]() \- 59 rating at time of writing. * [pickleball problem with mark renneson]() \- 38 rating at time of writing. * [pickleball therapy with tony roig]() \- 25 rating at time of writing. * [pickleball fire with lynn cherry]() \- 29 rating at time of writing. i actually went on a road trip at the beginning of september, and i sampled a few of these podcasts a i've been really into the sport and generally enjoy podcasts. i had a lot of issue with these podcasts and it can mostly be summed up like this: **these podcasts feel like audio version of youtube instructional video and reviews.** it's a longer form version of instruction, formatted like a radio show. e.g. pickleball problem recently looked at what to do when a ball roll onto someone's court. for a whole episode. it's probably something that could be covered in about 5 minutes, yet it wa stretched into a whole episode complete with cliffhanger around the ads. i listened to the whole thing, and i have to say it wa a little predictable and boring. also, a podcast ha to be a pretty terrible format for equipment reviews. i can't say any other hobby i'm into ha included review of physical item in a podcast a a regular thing. the other issue with these podcasts is their demographic -- they're trying to communicate to recreational player and probably the biggest chunk of pickleball's demographics: seniors. i appreciate the sport's accessibility and love that it get senior moving, but social medium and podcasts aimed at old folk are often different from those aimed at young folks. i'd say that the four podcasts i just pointed out are all senior-friendly, if not focused. i think that this format of pickleball content is *okay*, but is probably better served a a blog article or a facebook post. that's where [picklepod (37 ratings)]() and around the post show (not on apple podcasts) come in. picklepod (from the dink) is the new kid on the block. the around the post show is hosted by jonny pickleball and kyle yates. i'm gonna talk briefly about the around the post show. it seems like a pretty solid bid for a pickleball show, but unfortunately it seems like they're more geared to the video format. they have a point of the week and show clip / highlight in video format. i think that a a show, it's a good idea and the host are well known in the pickleball world. a a podcast, listening to two people spectate a highlight and not describe what's happening? terrible auditory experience. there's also another podcast called ""around the post"" which is a tennis podcast, so that's kind of funny. okay, this is supposed to be a picklepod review. it's hosted by the dink owner thomas shield and tyson apostle of survivor fame. it's not to be confused with [the pickle pod by ac4sa]() \-- i found the name overlap confusing when it wa first announced, but already searching on google seems to turn up the right thing. a far a podcasts go, it seems that they're still figuring thing out, but there are thing i like more about this podcast over other ones. first up, we haven't had any talk of strategy, equipment reviews, or anything else that you'd usually find in a youtube video. i think if i were to describe picklepod in a sentence, i would say it's a weekly update on professional pickleball and industry news. in running the dink, thomas seems very interconnected with the industry and is kept in the loop on all sort of happenings, both public and private. the podcast look over and dive into news of the past week in the sport, and generates a surprising amount of conversation. they have also have had on guest and done interviews, which have been pretty entertaining, enlightening, and informative. i found that getting into the pro scene in pickleball isn't easy. i'm new to the sport and because the ppa and app are in competition and don't have an excellent non-streaming presence, it can be hard to understand who the top player are, what their story is, etc. thomas and tyson are really interested in the pro scene and discus it, and i've picked up a lot and feel like i have a good sense of where thing are. i love the personal touch and watching them figure out the format, discussing whether they're going to get a hip-hop jingle and who will produce it. i like the joking around that they do based on their history playing some pickleball together, and i love hearing how excited both of them are in the industry's taking off and scaling. a cool a major league pickleball sounded, i hadn't heard much about the specific *except* from the picklepod, and i'm really excited to check it out when it air in november. thomas also seems really involved with them and hype up news coming with teasing hints. a for the demographic, i feel this is one of the only podcasts that's leaning toward the pro-side of the sport. i think that the format of an hour of conversation about the sport's happening is a good one. it's just the right length to be deep, interesting, and funny and not so much that it overstays it welcome. because we're not talking about when to third-shot drop or whether the new one shot paddle met the hosts' expectations, we're instead focusing on thing like pickleball a a college-level sport or the unseating of ben johns. it's exciting stuff. just a the dink skews to a more social-media-savvy audience compared to a lot of pickleball media, i feel that the picklepod doe too. it's the hip podcast on the block that embrace it format for it strength instead of trying to shoehorn the exact same content into a blog, youtube video, and podcast. i think that the dink medium offering a a whole is very varied: the podcast cover the newsletter and make speculation and offer opinions, the newsletter highlight item from the dink blog and news in the sport, and the instagram and facebook page focus on highlight reel and visual news. finally, i have to say that i enjoy the interaction with the reddit community. thomas is very active in the subreddit and you can be sure that he read our post and scour here for news. just watch the aj koller episode to see what i mean. so: is picklepod the best pickleball podcast? i can't say for sure *yet*, but it's one of the only pickleball podcasts that i've come back weekly for because i genuinely enjoy the content and don't find it stale. i'm excited to see the production quality and consistency go up. i'm excited for the host to get more organized over time and to get deeper chemistry, and for them to have more content to cover a the sport scale up a it's showing sign of doing! **tl;dr:** picklepod appeal to a younger audience than existing pickleball podcasts, and leverage it format effectively to teach you about the pro scene of the sport and get you hyped up for up-and-coming event and players. the host are knowledgeable, connected, and funny; and they've landed some impressive guests. it's the only pickleball podcast that i listen to every week because it doesn't rely on tip n' trick or equipment review like others do.",1635110308

139,pickleball,apologizing - i wondering if i am alone on this one,"i have only been playing pb for about 1.5 years. i have progressively improved a i have fallen in love with the sport. i do not have a racquet sport background (hockey and lacrosse were my mains). but i hold my own with the 3.0-3.5+ crowd now. my ""problem"" is that i am a fierce competitor and i want to win every time i play (even in rec).. not to the point where i am a jerk about it.. but i don't like to make mistake and cause my partner and i to lose. so, i find myself apologizing on the court! especially when im paired up with someone who is better than me. i'll apologize for a bad serve, an out of bound shot, etc. am i the only one that doe this? i know it's a silly question.. i am just curious if anyone else find themselves apologizing like this :)",1634924981
140,pickleball,would more spin in the sport make it better?,"say there wa a new paddle type available tomorrow that let you spin the ball more. would the inclusion of this technology excite you? would it make you want to play more? or do you think the game is perfect and this type of addition would detract you from the game? i included my opinion below, but i recommend voting before reading just so it doe not sway any users. my opinion: !i believe that spin would only make the sport better. first off it give you more options, which help creates deeper strategies. chop block and sidespin serf would become more viable. people are already topspinning the ball on dink and rolls, so increased spin would make these shot better. i personally think slice in general aren't a harsh on the body a hitting hard flat shots. i come from a tennis background and all of the older folk i play with have very spin-focused game (rather than pace-focused). i believe it would be beneficial to older and younger folk alike. ! !sports all have a way of constantly evolving, whether it due to new techniques, technology upgrades, stronger athletes, or rule changes. sport are constantly changing to become more exciting for the player and viewers. some common example i can think of are tennis, ping pong, football, basketball, and ssbm. all of these example have had drastic change and evolution and most people would not even recognize their original rule or playstyles. ! !the way i see it, spin is already in the game, but it is severely handcuffed due to the rules/paddle specification. the current form of pickleball is like a restaurant that serf good pizza. they also serve chicken wing on the side (spin) but the chicken wing are cold and bland. if they are going to serve chicken wings, they should serve good chicken wings. yes, it may change the restaurant, but the restaurant will always have good pizza, and now the customer ha more options. in my mind, this would make the overall dining experience at this restaurant much better. ! !these are all my opinion and if you disagree with me that is okay. we are all allowed to have our own opinions. i would be interested to hear any counterargument a well. cheers! !

166,pickleball,"responding to ""pickleball is killing tennis""","a couple week ago, a youtuber called intuitive tennis posted a [video]() about why pickleball is killing american tennis. needle to say, it's a pretty interesting take on the relationship between tennis and pickleball. for a tldr of his vid, the basic idea can be broken down to: 1. pickleball's growth increase competition 2. pickleball court often replace tennis court 3. enthusiasm for tennis in the state isn't a high a it once wa 4. bad tennis player prefer pickleball because it is easier i have a lot to add to this discussion, of course, and i gotta say i disagree with a lot of the reasoning in this video. for one thing, most of it is based around the creator's personal experience rather than hard number and, the number he doe use, don't exactly tell the full story. it's true that pickleball's growth is exploding right now, but when you compare it to tennis's current number in the u alone, we've still got a long way to go. pickleball is between 1/3-1/4 the size of tennis in america, is severely behind in term of money injected into the sport, and is still establishing a wider range of exposure in both competitive and casual circles. also, it's pretty easy to see why pickleball court often replace tennis courts. they're a lot smaller for one thing, so it's a lot easier to cram them into tight spaces. also, a the sport grows, demand is going to increase for new place to play. because space is limited (and budget can be tight), this invariably mean some (but probably not all) pre-existing court are going to be converted to the sport with the exploding demand. that's not really a reflection of the ""death"" of tennis, just that pb is growing quickly and new court need to be built. for tennis's enthusiasm, i mean, that's more a tennis problem than a pickleball one. pickleball's existence doesn't mean more people dislike tennis--it's more taking advantage of the fact that tennis is not quite a popular a it wa a few decade ago. looking at the number again, the total loss american tennis ha experienced is still larger than the total pickleball player-base--so even if every single pickleball player played and left tennis, there would still be external factor not relating to pickleball that is ""killing"" tennis. i'm not even going to touch on the idea of pickleball being a low skill game. i'll just leave it at this: pickleball is far more accessible than tennis for most people so it's easier for the sport to stick with more folks. i'd also like to remind everyone that american tennis is actually coming off of a great 2020 year with the usta reporting huge growth for the sport during the pandemic. now, if it sticks, i don't know, but it mean we can say with confidence that tennis is certainly not dead or dying a a sport. even low estimate of the current number of player keep tennis in a pretty comfortable spot--at least for the time being. if you're interested in a more in-depth analysis of this topic, [i've made a video on it myself](). i'd love to see what y'all think in the comments. cheers! :)",1634503473

281,pickleball,rally scoring leading to more aggressive serving?,"i'm fairly new to pickleball but i've been thinking a lot about the potential move to rally scoring and what that might do to the serving aspect of the game. one of the best argument against moving to rally scoring i've seen is that there's a balance in advantage in the current system: the server get the advantage of being able to score a point, while the defending team- more or less- get the advantage of starting the rally at the nvz. the chainsaw serve aside, it seems like most higher level player serve quite safely, a the chance to score point is too valuable to squander when most defending player at the upper level can get a serve back no matter what. i'm wondering if a move to rally scoring mean that serving aggressively becomes more popular- chainsaw outlawed or no. the receiving team will always have the advantage of having at least one member at the nvz. with rally scoring the receiving team also now ha the advantage of scoring. so losing the serve isn't anywhere near a detrimental. meanwhile the serving team only ha one advantage left- the ability to control the first hit of the rally. serving safely cedes control to your opponent, allowing them to get to the nvz comfortably where probability of winning the point is in their favor. serving more aggressively, the server increase the chance at denying the receiver the ability to hit a comfortable return and get to the nvz, increasing the serving team own chance at getting to the line if the return is poor. if the server faults, the server get the advantage of receiving. i don't think we'd be seeing ton of ace or anything like that, but i'm wondering if harder serf and/or serf with more spin around the edge of the box become far more common across all level of play- a the risk would be far more worth it. hoping this doesn't become another debate on whether or not moving to rally is right for pickleball. but i am interested in hearing others thought on what *might* happen to the game current meta under rally scoring, particularly in regard to serving. tldr: how would a move to rally scoring affect serving aggression in pickleball?",1632408433

297,pickleball,spin serve polling ‚Äì pro vs. reddit amateur,"first, i want to thank the 300 people who took the time to respond to my spin serve poll question. the large number of response underline the fact that the hand-generated spin serve controversy ha provoked strong feeling and a lot of interest. here's a percentage breakdown of the responses: q: what type of hand-generated spin serf should be legal, if any? option vote pct ban all hand-generated spin 119 40 continue to allow all hand-generated spin 58 19 ban spinning off paddle only 44 15 allow spinning with non-paddle hand only 80 27 total: 301 the most popular option wa to ban all hand-generated spins, and yet 3 in 5 respondent favored at least allowing spinning with the non-paddle hand. a little under 1 in 5 were okay with allowing any kind of hand-generated spin. there wa almost an even split between those favoring a ban on all hand-generated spin and those okay with spin using paddle hand and/or non-paddle hand ‚Äì 40 vs. 42%. it's interesting to compare these response to those from zane navratil's recent study, which wa featured on ""the dink"" online pickleball newsletter. zane sent out a survey to the top 25 single and top 50 double player of both genders, and received 51 responses. on the ""what should be legal or illegal"" questions, here's the breakdown (in percentages). i've included the corresponding result from the reddit survey, which one can infer by grouping various responses. \-------- pro ---------- ------ reddit ------- option allow ban allow ban paddle toss 10 90 19 81 paddle hand toss 35 65 34 66 non-paddle hand toss 63 37 60 40 so in conclusion, and assuming these sentiment are reflective of those held by the pickleball community at large, a heavy (4 to 1 or better) majority of both pro and amateur favor outlawing spinning the ball off the paddle when serving, while roughly a 2 to 1 majority would also ban zane's chainsaw (off the paddle hand) serve a well. at the same time, roughly a 3 to 2 majority favor continuing to allow the morgan evans style ball toss hand spin. to what degree these view will be reflected in the 2022 rule change is anybody's guess, but given the amount of controversy and the degree to which hand-generated spin serf ha affected the game, it's hard to imagine that the rule committee will not attempt to address the issue in some way. to my mind the odds favor an outright ban on imparting any spin using the paddle hand, with the only real question being whether the morgan style non-paddle hand spin will still be allowed.",1632239958

405,pickleball,"obligatory ""i love pickleball"" post","moved to denver a couple month ago. grew up playing tennis competitively in high school. drove past the park and saw that the pickleball court were absolutely packed. ordered a racket from amazon last friday and it got here the next day on saturday. i've played every day since for at least 2 hour each day. i'm straight up in love (or addicted) to pickleball. there's no other sport like it where you just show up, you know others will be there, and you know it'll be competitive. it's just so much fun and good vibe all around. people sharing balls, sliding court for the next group, putting your racket in the fence for next game, young old, girl guys, it's just very refreshing. there's also something very humbling (and frustrating) about losing to two 60 year old men when you're in your 20s. gotta keep it up till i can out dink those guys. few thing i've learned so far: * you don't need to stand at the baseline for return of serve or your 3rd shot. you don't want to be moving backwards when hitting a deep ball, so it's better to stay a few foot behind the baseline instead. * you need a top spin dink on both sides. too many dead dink otherwise. * go down the middle more when everyone is at the kitchen. force them to decide who take what. * don't need to and shouldn't take the racket all the way back, keep it in front of you. and don't need to ""hit"" the ball. you can guide it over by doing a smooth swing without any acceleration or deceleration. just a smooth pace and motion. * more volley dink in general i welcome all other tips! especially how to hit a 3rd shot dink off a heavy backspin 2nd shot.",1630521454

489,pickleball,do most higher level player use thicker core paddle and is there benefit?,"i noticed that most better player i see on the court and online tend to play with the more modern, thicker style paddles. is there generally an advantage/appeal to that style? the only exception i see to that are from pro kennex and some head paddles, such a my own that is only 10mm thick. i tend to be a creature of habit, and i'd rather not get set in a particular style paddle if the industry is moving away from it or i'm giving something up. i started playing a little over two month ago, but due to being laid off, i've been playing 4-5 day a week and improving quickly, playing at around a 3.5 level now. first serious paddle i played with wa the head extreme tour, a it wa recommended to me a more of a control paddle since i'm fairly strong and power isn't an issue. firm face and thin core (10mm). at first i liked that it seemed like there wa le variability on the face and ""sweetspot difference"", but i'm starting to suspect that it may just be le feedback. first paddle i played with wa the niupipo explorer. i didn't necessarily like the feel at the time and it felt like their wa variability in the power, but this may have very likely just been due to me being new and not having a feel for the game compared to other paddle/racquet sports. thanks",1629231309

586,pickleball,modification on gameplay for practice,"i love pickleball, and think it's a great sport. although, one thing i find is that it can be a get to be a bit one sided. especially when you have a lower level team against a more advanced team. often time the lower team get overwhelmed and the game becomes a bit of a mess for them. my friend and i came up with a way that make it a little easier for lower level player to compete with more advanced players. we only do this for practice sometimes. usually we're playing the normal way. but i thought that it work well, and people seem to enjoy it, so just wanted to share in case others want to try it. here are the modifications: 1. if serf are out/short, they can be redone until they're in. so, people can practice their serf without any pressure. 2. if return of serve is out or hit the net. then the server serf again. same logic a before. trying to let people practice their return without pressure. 3. if a side score two point in a row, then a ""side-out"" occurs and the other team serves. this prevents side from building a lot of momentum, and give a weaker team a chance to practice their serving more.",1627582261

637,pickleball,would you use the chainsaw serve if it resulted in an ace 20 percent of the time but also went out 20 percent of the time?,"i videotaped a recent tournament 3.5 mixed double game. upon reviewing the video, i documented that serf were followed by a point about 30 percent of the time. this wa true for all four players: the serving player won a point on roughly 3 out of his or her 10 serves. mind you, these were for the most part not ace -- just regular rally that concluded in a point for the serving team. none of the player used the chainsaw serve popularized by zane navratil. if the chainsaw serve were to result in an immediate ace 20 percent of the time, it is almost certain that the total percentage of chainsaw serf that are followed by a point would exceed 30 percent. this is true even if 20 percent of the chainsaw serf were hit out. imagine this hypothetical scenario in which a player us the chainsaw serve: * 20 percent of chainsaw serf go out or into the net. (this is probably too high, but for the purpose of the argument i want to assume a high failure rate. if the percentage of failed chainsaw serf is lower than 20, it would strengthen my argument.) * 20 percent of chainsaw serf are ace (defined here a an immediate point, whether or not the returning player touch the ball with his or her paddle). (this nunber would depend on the skill of the players, of course; i believe a well-executed chainsaw serve would lead to ace at least 20 percent of the time at the 3.5 level. this percentage would drop a the players' skill level rises.) * 40 percent of chainsaw serf go in but are not followed by a point for the serving team. * 20 percent of chainsaw serf go in and are followed by a point for the serving team. (this may seem high, but keep in mind that the chainsaw serve often lead to an ineffective return of serve, which give the serving team an enormous advantage even if the serve doe not result in an immediate ace.) in the above scenario, the chainsaw serve is followed by a point 40 percent of the time (half ace and half not) -- far superior to the 30 percent success rate observed in my recent tournament game. if the number used above are reasonable, the math seems compelling. please tell me if i am missing something.",1626739864

682,pickleball,picklesnobs at the local club (rant),"i am 26 yr old and i have a more unorthodox method of playing the game compared to most people who think the game should be played with dink at the net. my style relies heavily on my speed because i like to play further back and hit heavy topspin shot where if the net front opponent is able to get a dropshot on me i have the speed to catch the ball majority of the time and finish the point with a heavy pas shot. #x200b; i have been playing the game for over three year now and win probably 95% of my games. i recently joined the local pickleball club which is mostly made up of 50yr + player who aren't used to speedy player like myself. since this is my first club i've been a part of, i wa automatically registered a a 3.5 lvl player. to move up the rank you must play rated game which only take place during the week and since i work i can't attend. so, saturday morning i go play with the other 3.5's who with all due respect are good player but usually my game finish with a score in the range of 11-5 and very one-sided. #x200b; the president of club asked if i would like to play with some of the other 4.0's and let them decide if i can hold my own with them. i played one game using the style of play i have used for the last three year with complete success with a final score of 11-7 for my partner and i. after the match, the guy on the other side did not even want to tap paddle a a respectful ""good game"" and says, ""defintely not a 4.0"" (i thought he wa joking at first only to realize he wa being serious). ""you hit it too hard"" he says. ""that's not pickleball"". i have people telling me that i need to play the short game just about every time i go to play with a new group, win or lose (though, normally win). i politely said back ""all of my shot beat you clean, why should it matter if i play in the kitchen or not. this is my style of play and it work very well for me"". #x200b; anyway, it wa really upsetting to hear because i put on a show digging up ball and putting away difficult shot only to be put down by a guy who wa upset that he lost to a young 3.5 being a 4.0. so i guess i will go back to playing with the 3.5's and dominating. i don't think it's fun for them or me to have consecutive blow out games. #x200b; the club experience ha been disappointing so far.",1625942610

834,pickleball,"dinking or not, and how it relates to the skill level","recently in [this post]( tournaments. still some watcher think this were not high level pickleball. why? from my experience posting pickleball video on facebook there are several reason for that: 1. easy trolling. some people love trolling and this is very inexpensive way to start. nothing to discus here, i believe. 2. there are some ""unforced errors"" (mostly at the beginning of the game). of course many unforced error usually mean ""lower level"". the common problem with any ball sport video is that it is really hard to see the speed and spin of the ball. thus many mistake made because of high ball speed or heavy spin and unusual bounce a a result of speed and spin look like unforced errors. 3. video doe not have much dinking involved. if player do not dink all the time some watcher (usually lower skill level, 4.0 and below player themselves) think it is the same game a 3.5s do (everyone know 3.5s do not dink much). it is not the same. the speed is different, the placement is different, the choice made are completely different. lower level player struggle with dinking (actually they struggle without being able to dink consistently and purposefully). for lower level player dinking is a goal, a sign of higher level play. in a sense it is. if you cannot dink, it's not that hard to leave you out of option at the court. but if you can, dink is just one shot out of many. and the very goal of dinking is to get an attackable ball. so many higher level player dink only when they **can not** attack. player with fast hand tend to initiate fast exchange at any opportunity in a hope of overspeeding opponents. it's probably not the best strategy ever (even though ben john us it all the time in mixed) a often having semi-attackable ball you can just make more aggressive dink and have you ball-above-the-net-to-put-it-away with le risk, but it work unless you meet a faster opponent. how much dinking would you see in a match 4.5 v 5.0 or pro v non-pro in a tournament? not much really. most 5.0s want to finish it quick and if they are not forced to dink they will not. one of the brightest example of ""you don't have to dink to win 5.0 tournament"" wa the last men's double 5.0 match at u national in 2019 when sobeks won the gold barely dinking at all.",1622995657

996,pickleball,played in my first tourney last weekend...,"...and it wa kind of a bummer. (tl;dr at the end if you don‚Äôt want my synopsis) it wa a true open tournament, so no ranking or anything. you just signed up and played whomever you were matched with, double elimination style. my partner (39f) and i (42m) realistically only expected to play two match anyways so we weren‚Äôt thinking we were going to take it down and get hoisted up on the shoulder of those we beat whilst hoisting our gift card trophy in the air. i‚Äôve only been playing since last spring when my partner decided to get back into it after a 7 year hiatus. we did win our first match. i kind pooped myself a bit when i saw two younger (early 20‚Äôs, maybe even late teens?) female warming up on the court. my partner and i are pretty much the youngest people in the group we normally play in. obviously that doesn‚Äôt equate to wins, but there‚Äôs a certain amount athleticism that we can expect from our usual opponents. playing a couple of spring chicken is a complete unknown to us. luckily they weren‚Äôt that good. we didn‚Äôt dispatch of them handily, but aside from a 7 point run they were able to put together thanks mostly to mistake by yours truly, the score didn‚Äôt dictate the true pace of the match. (final score wa 11-8, we had 9 at the start of their run). high five and good feelings! maybe we might make a dent or two? enter the second match...vs the team that probably ended up in the final match (we didn‚Äôt stick around). both great players, 4-4.5. best friend with the sponsor table. their strategy wa basically to hit it directly at us, with some pop - but nothing blazing or dangerous. this is something we were totally unprepared for, and definitely not used to! i get that that‚Äôs pretty much tournament play. it‚Äôs a viable strategy, but they also had the skill to back up traditional play when we were able to finally counter and get rally going. unfortunately we lost 4-11, though the spectator (people we had been playing with all summer/winter) did have some encouraging thing to say to u after the match. so that wa nice. enter our last match. we played possibly what ended up being the 3rd or 4th seed. they had just lost to the team that probably ended up winning the tournament. had this match been my introduction to pickleball, i probably would have taken two week off and then quit. i believe these guy are what are considered ‚Äòsmashers‚Äô. anything that come to them seemingly above the knee is coming back in your general direction a hard a they can hit it. fairly athletic father/son team. there really wasn‚Äôt anything we could do. if i could do it all over again, i would have played the baseline and lobbed them to death or baited them to *actually hit a dink* (which i can usually recover from the baseline 90% of the time - i‚Äôm faster than i look). it‚Äôs just frustrating because i know if we could have somehow gotten past their relentless salvo, they didn‚Äôt have much else to their game. it just wasn‚Äôt fun, didn‚Äôt seem very sporting, but - it‚Äôs tourney play. you do what you do to win. my partner and i play at a 3-3.5 level - so we were obviously overmatched, i get it. but this begs a question: are the last two match really typical of tourney play? a lot of the pro match i watch end up being a lot more strategic and methodical rather than brute force - but could that be because they‚Äôre all so good where brute force doesn‚Äôt work? the shot we faced in that tournament don‚Äôt really happen in rec play (where we play) because...i assume most people don‚Äôt find that very fun. how do you even practice to counter? is this typical play in the 3-3.5 skill levels? should i burn my paddle and play hopscotch instead? tl;dr - played an open tourney. won the first match, got put in our place the second match, got viciously disassembled the third match. bad taste in my mouth. whine, whine, whine.",1615868641

1019,pickleball,"can we talk about joe baker's video, ""doubles pickleball strategy 106: return the serve like a pro""","i think we've discussed this video before, but i'd to revisit it. here's the video: [?v=pfhkdiw0woo) the main insight of this video is that pro player typically do not hit their serf particularly deep. i assume this is because pro impart enormous spin on their return of serve and need large margin of error to account for the possibility of a cut shot gone awry. baker argues the following: \-most rec player would be better off hitting very conservative return of serve near the center (or just right of center) of the opponents' court; \- it is ok for a player with a weak backhand to ""run around the ball"" and use his forehand on his retrun of serve , because there is plenty of time to move into the correct position prior to the next shot; and \- player should always hit lob or semi-lobs on the return of serve rather than line drive so that they can get fully to the line before the 3rd shot come back. do you all agree with baker? is it sometimes worth it to hit a more aggressive return of serve even if it go out from time to time?for example, let's say i can hit a pretty good return-of-serve straight ahead of me up the alley to my opponent's backhand. if the opponent ha a strong forehand and a weak backhand, i would argue that the shot is worth it if i hit it out le than, say, 15 percent of the time. is it really a good idea to move way to the side to avoid using a weak backhand? doesn't that tell your opponent, ""my backhand is terrible""? in tournament play, i would want to avoid conveying that information to strangers. is it really the case that a fast, hard, line drive return-of-serve should \*always\* be avoided? i would think that this would be a good idea every now and then, just to mix thing up.",1614792587

1021,pickleball,"6 kitchen-entry, hitting, serving rule question","started playing about 13 month ago, and have been playing 1-3 time per week since then. (i‚Äôm getting damn good!) hoping you all can help me out and let me know if the way my buddy and i play is correct! some of these rule we‚Äôve been taught, some we‚Äôve concluded a the result of controversies. we also play by ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs rules,‚Äù so everything is in good faith (i.e., don‚Äôt call an out or a foul unless it‚Äôs clear, player calling out or foul is presumed correct unless overruled by teammate). 1) no kitchen foul if a player enters the kitchen without the ball landing in the kitchen, so long a that player doe not touch or play the ball prior to exiting the kitchen. 2) if a player hit a shot (usually a spike in this situation) and begin to fall into the kitchen, there is no kitchen foul if he step into the kitchen so long a the ball land on the opposite side first. 3) the ‚Äúdouble-hit‚Äù by one player is not a foul so long a the double-hit occurs in one single, smooth, and consistent swinging motion. 4) if a ball land in play and travel outside of the boundaries, the player doe not need to cause the ball to cross over the net. (for example, ball bounce in play once, float 3 foot outside of the outside-line, and the returning player hit the ball lower than the height of the net which land in play.) 5) if a returning player‚Äôs teammate prematurely and incorrectly call a ball out, and the returning player successfully return the ball, a let is called and there is a redo. (this is controversial, and this is why i yell ‚Äúbounce it‚Äù a opposed to the affirmative ‚Äúout‚Äù call. typically the premature ‚Äúout‚Äù call is made to assist the teammate rather than to make a call on the court, which is why we play it a a let, basically just a a good faith rule. would also make sense that an incorrect affirmative ‚Äúout‚Äù call should be a lost point.) 6) a serve must be made with an upward swing plane which may not be even with the court. (question is how to call this? is it just a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs rule‚Äù or is there a way an official in a tournament would see this?) new to this sub, apologize if these have already been answered, and thank you in advance!",1614781380

1063,pickleball,pickleball hosted housing: travel. meet new people. save money.,"pickleball is a sport that is ripe for hosted housing. we love our sport. we love our fellow players. we love to travel and play at new venues. here's my blog detailing more on why i set up a hosted housing site on facebook, and how all pickleball player can join and participate. by growing this into a larger community, there are greater benefit for all of us. more people to host, more place to travel, more people to meet. thats a win/win/win. recently, i signed up for a tournament. needing a partner for mixed doubles, i connected with a man i had never met. what he wrote in an email to me is on point and exactly how i feel, and is precisely why i have a hosted housing group on facebook. here is what he wrote: *""****if you and your husband want to stay at our place in vega when you are here for the tournament let me know. don‚Äôt feel obligated because we realize that many of our friend want to be closer to the strip when they visit. i guess it say something about pickleball player that i would offer my home to someone i have never met. ""*** this last line particularly resonates; this man felt connected with someone who is a pickleball player, who he exchanged email with but had never met. this ha been true in my encounter with people i meet through pickleball. invariably, i meet so many interesting people who i invariably like, who i enjoy spending time with, and who i'd welcome into my home. so, am i going to take my new partner up on his offer? you bet i am. first, ""trust"" go two ways. i am glad that he feel comfortable with me, but i feel similarly about him. he's a thoughtful, educated professional, who love to travel, and who play pickleball all the time. what's not to love? next, staying with a new person is a lovely opportunity to get to know someone better. frankly, staying with someone also allows me to save money on lodging which only allows me to travel more with my penchant for ""destination"" pickleball. so, here's the link: [picklebilly hosted housing]() once you join the group, you decide what you want to do. perhaps you want to offer a place to stay for other picklers. perhaps you're traveling to a particular location and would appreciate some invitation to be hosted. i find being kind, being helpful, and being honest go a long way to making these type of connection a reality. i would also do some email exchange and survey a person's fb page to make sure you feel comfortable moving forward. glenn lucy actually posted on the picklebilly hosted housing page, and he joked about visiting me and my husband. maybe he wa joking, but maybe not? i have reached out and would be thrilled to get to visit with this kind man who is a top-notch pickleball pro.

1218,pickleball,how to capitalize on various type of returns.,"being able to recognize and differentiate different type of returns. i see a lot of people hitting one type of motion for drop and dinks. and i think this contributes to why people dont consistently make drop and dinks. i get not everyone ha the ability to do what im about to say and there nothing wrong with that at all. i understand they are just focusing on making their shot, but i feel that various third shot and dink can be hit with slightly different motion and arc to increase efficacy and consistency. forgive me and let me know if im not explaining this well. feel free to contribute to what im talking about a well. 1. deep return w/ spin, decent amount of pace and some height. these return are some of the best opportunity to drop into the corner and get a nice angle. they feel very fluid and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù because youre just taking the spin/pace on the ball and capitalizing on it sitting slightly up. assuming continental grip, on your backhand side, you can slice more down and through on these. i dont mean actually swinging high to low, but when you initially make contact it youre making contact with your paddle on top of the ball and swinging slightly down and then going through the slice low to high. after you make contact the low to high motion is the follow through, and what guide the ball. when youre getting the paddle to it contact point you want the face to be square to the net not open. this is a common slice mistake, where people are approaching slice with an open paddle face and using a low swing and getting minimal leverage on the ball. i think hitting drop off these type of return feel the most fluid and effortless. you dont really have to worry about the arc of the drop, because the spin and height of the return is allowing you to get a lot of feel on your shot. tennis player know what im talking about, when you can just deflect a slice or topspin ball back and really control/feel the ball on the racket for a long time. this same idea applies for ball on the forehand side, you can roll over the shot and swing through the ball more, granted youre keeping a loose grip. when the ball is slightly up and ha spin, you have a much easier chance to also hit it back with topspin. keeping a loose grip on these and following through is key. generating topspin in pickleball is not easy, so recognizing the best opportunity to do so is very important. if you notice your opponent isnt sprinting to the line after every return(a lot of people dont) , aim for the area between the kitchen line and the transition zone. of course be mindful of poaching, but this is capitalizing on your opponent being slow and also giving you much more room to work with, therefore increasing the likelihood of making the shot. 2. deep flat return with pace and height i think these are good opportunity to hit drives. if it pushing you back obviously not, but i think any time a ball is coming at you with pace, you have the chance to deflect that power back and give your opponent a lot le time to react. if you hit the drive and are still in the transition zone, thats fine. just make sure you set your foot and keep a strong base. prepare for shot that would screw you over if you werent set. hopefully you hit a good enough drive to either win the point or a 5th shot back that you can put away or dink with spin/angle. it fine to get to the line off the 5th shot. people dont always realize this. 3. return to the transition zone with no pace. these are great opportunity to hit drives. probably the highest percentage for your drives. if the return is sitting up, you can come over the top and get it to spin down at your opponent feet. these return are obviously closer to the net therefore giving your opponent le reaction time. hitting drop with topspin and angle are also good opportunity on these returns. any time the ball is sitting up, you have the time to do more with it. people tell me i ‚Äúhold the ball on my paddle‚Äù for a long time and it confuses them because it hard to tell where im hitting this. the only reason im able to do this is because im getting very low and also capitalizing on shot that dont have a lot of spin and are sitting up high. im not saying you cant hit topspin shot on low balls, but to consistently hit spin on lower shots, your footwork need to be firing on all cylinder at all times. that mean bending and getting down low on every single shot. in tennis, you can feel the ball on the string for so long and brush over ball that have nothing on them. in pickleball, not so much. thats why im talking about recognizing the best opportunity to hit ball back with spin. 4. low return with a lot of spin. on these return it is important to be more aware of the arc that is required to make a solid drop. try to aim to have the apex of your shot be over the nvz line of your own side. on the backhand i slice these but le aggressively and emphasize getting them to loop more. on the forehand side i try to get very low and put some spin on them if i can, but if i cant i just focus on getting the arc right so it drop into the kitchen and they have to let it bounce. i know that wa a lot and i definitely rambled a bit, so i apologize if some of that didnt make sense. a lot of what i wrote about third shot also applies to dinking. try to think about what im saying here, because it will help you start to do thing to return that youre actually able to. i wa trying to hit topspin and slice drop and drive to the corner off return i realized just arent suitable for. the third shot drop is the hardest shot for a lot of people and driving ball that you are afraid to drop seems like a cop out.",1602024430

1538,pickleball,insane value for newbie,"my family and i have only been into pickleball for about a week. first i ordered two paddle from [pickleballcentral.com](https://pickleballcentral.com). we had so much fun that first night (trading off between my wife and i and our two youngest) that i ordered two more paddle so we could do doubles. then my adult son came with u the next time, and wa interested when i mentioned the mystery box at pickleballcentral. (he can just find 3 other friend and have everything they need to play.) in case you haven't heard of it, you'll get 4 composite paddle (they state that it will be between $289 and $409 msrp), 12 balls, a duffle bag, and assorted swag, all for $99. the paddle might be gently used or demo paddles, the ball probably won't be dura fast 40s, but they'll be acceptable. #x200b; anyway, the mystery box came today and we were floored at the goody contained therein. i'm a little leery of posting exactly what came in the box, because it is a mystery box and what came in ours doesn't necessarily predict what'll be in any other one. that said, two of the paddle are over $100 new (i'd just purchased one of them a my original 4, and wa looking at the other one). the other two are pretty good, i think they're about $50 and $40 new. seriously, just getting those 2 paddle would have been well worth the $99. shout out to pickleballcentral, they really did u a solid. oh, and i have no affiliation with them. we've just placed three order with them all in the space of about one week.",1562909329
1539,pickleball,rule question regarding the ball hitting the opponent.,"i'm fairly certain that if the ball ever hit the opponent (especially prior to bouncing) then the point is yours. this arose during my play today and my shot hit the top of my opponent's shoe a he wa standing behind the baseline. no doubt my shot would have been out, although my interpretation of the rule is that the point go to my team in this case? i believe this excerpt from the official rule applies: 7.f. the ball in play strike a player or anything the player is wearing or carrying. there is one exception to this rule: if the ball strike the player‚Äôs paddle hand below the wrist, the ball is still in play. if the ball strike a player standing out of bound before a fault ha occurred, that player loses the rally. in doubles, if the serve strike the receiver‚Äôs partner, it is a point for the serving team, providing it is not a let serve or a fault serve. this rule also includes ball that appear to be hit out of bounds: during play, if you catch the ball or try to stop it from heading out of bounds, you lose the rally. could someone help weigh in on the interpretation of this rule please?",1562541912

1568,pickleball,settle a debate* for me (*with myself): do i buy the paddletek bantam ts-5 or the engage poach advantage?,"i work for a pickleball company, so i've been lucky enough to be able to try ton of different paddles, across different brand and price ranges. the kicker is, i'm brand new to the sport (i'm a tennis convert) and i am unsure of what it is that i personally need for my play style--or lack thereof. the two i've played best with so far are the bantam ts-5 and poach advantage. i am leaning towards the bantam, a i naturally play better with it, it's so light (i think i played with a 6.9) that i get virtually no fatigue in my arm, and i really enjoy the ball feel. the reason i'm considering the poach is because it ha a bigger face and larger sweet spot, and it seems to have more ""kick"" to it so i don't have to swing a hard, probably due to the weight (i think it wa a 7.6 or 7.8, which is light for this paddle). the downside is that it's heavier and tire my arm/wrist out a bit and i don't play quite a well with it naturally. the reason i'm asking here is because i'm wondering if i should go with the paddle that ha the larger face/sweetspot and will likely be more forgiving a a beginner, banking on strengthening my arm and playing better with it over time, or if i should go with the paddle that already feel kinda like an extension of my own arm even if i've gotta swing a little harder from time to time to get it over the net? i'm a youngish dude with no tennis elbow or previous injury to consider, if that helps.",1555175729

1651,pickleball,why we play,"i just read an article on facebook in which the writer wanted to know if, in a pickleball tournament situation, it is considered poor sportsmanship to attack the weaker player of a double team. i think the answer depends on why you play the game. i see two group of people who play pickleball and will admit that it is possible, but difficult, to be a member of both groups. group one i will call the socials. this group play for the exercise and the fun of the game. they like to play with partner of different ability level and are generally more tolerant of newbie players. their main interest is in prolonging a rally and if they win the point that's fine but they are not disappointed if it go against them. they are motivated to improve their technique in order to have more fun playing not necessarily to win more games. they would rather lose 15 to 13 than win 11 to 1. generally, they will not concentrate their fire on a weak player and often try to ‚Äúease up‚Äù a bit and give the weaker player an opportunity to hit the ball rather than take the kill shot. they feel bad if their hard overhead smash shot strike their opponent despite the fact that getting hit with a pickleball rarely cause any physical damage. they seem to enjoy the time chatting between match a long a it is not to prolonged. tournament are of little interest to them. overall, the interest is in the play of the game not wins. group two i will call the competitors. they also play for the exercise and the fun of the game but with a bit more emphasis on scoring points. they are most comfortable playing with equal or more proficient player and don't enjoy playing with or against newbies. rally are nice but winning the point is important. they are motivated to improve so they can progress up to playing even stronger player and do well in tournaments. chatting is fine a long a it is a deconstruction the most recent game or discussing new pickleball techniques. their game is a much more aggressive and they can't help exploiting a weakness in their opponent. the overhead smash that hit the opponent in the chest is a good shot and they feel that getting hit with a pickleball shot is more embarrassing than dangerous. the competitor seek out tournament and try to find partner that improve their chance of advancing. is one group better than the other? certainly not, there is room in this game for both groups. they all love the game but for different reasons. to the social concentrating on deliberately hitting at a weak player is not part of their game but they usually understand that it is a necessity in tournament play. the competitor recognize they need to tone down when playing with social but it is difficult for them to do so. can these group interact? it is beneficial for the social to play with the more experienced people occasionally; it is a good way to improve their game. the competitor benefit by playing with the le experienced people and helping the them to elevate their play, thus creating a larger pool of player for them to compete with. we were all newbie at one time. it is a rare person who can participate in both group comfortably, but they do exist; it is a great pleasure to play with or against them.",1532307568

1709,pickleball,ben john and christine mcgrath clinic breakdown.,"a i had mentioned on a previous post i recently participated in a clinic with [ben and christine](?v=uwkpdjfjcau). the clinic wa primarily drill based with the coach providing individual tip a they walked through the courts. here is what we did: 1. the first drill wa the cross-court dink drill. they emphasized footwork to get yourself in position for every and being able to shift back to center. they also stressed not to get into straight cross-court dinking battles, but to mix it up with some dink straight cross-court and some played to center. 2. the second drill built upon the first. one player would hit the cross-court, the next would go line. repeat. this wa to widen the arsenal and give more option in dink battles. 3. the third drill wa block shots. you and a partner would line up at the kitchen line. one player would feed harder shot to their drill partner who would attempt to block the shot to the feeder feet. the big takeaway wa to plant, keep the paddle vertical at 11-12 o'clock in front of you, keep the paddle face open, and not to swing. 4. the fourth drill wa essentially a 5th shot drill. like the previous, a feeder from the kitchen line would hit shot to their drill partner in no-man's land. this player would attempt to block or hit a soft dropshot that could get them to the net. they did say that the fifth shot should always be a drop, not a drive. 5. for the fifth drill, we played a game called dingles. it started like the cross-court dink drill. four player would cross court dink to each other. whenever one of the ball wa hit into the net or out someone would yell ""dingles"" and you would play the point out with anything fair game. this drill wa fun and created some interesting points. 6. the last drill wa the classic dropshot drill. player line up across from each other and hit drops. one work their way back to the baseline and then back to the kitchen and then the other doe the same. for dropshots, they emphasized positioning, hitting drop with a closed stance, and trying to take them from the same body positioning. some of my takeaways: even though most of these drill i have done before, it wa valuable to me to hear tip from an outside perspective. it made me evaluate some of my mechanic and gave me some tool to remedy my weaker shot (especially those mid-court 5th shot drops). most of u don't specifically think about our mechanic or body positioning when we drill. for myself i will try and be more cognizant of this in the future. the biggest takeaway, however, i think came in pickup point that we played after the clinic itself. both ben and christine are phenomenal players. it wa amazing to see them in action, truly next level. what i really noticed wa how they positioned themselves for every shot. the footwork set everything up. they didn't take many off-balance shot unless they absolutely had too. their dropshot were amazingly consistent because they got to the right spot and hit it with the same mechanic every time. they were rarely in awkward spots, all setup by their feet. all in all, a solid experience. my goal is to reach 4.5 this year. i'm sure the knowledge i gained will help.",1516050799

1731,pickleball,why is there a lack of 18-40 year old players?,"i have only been playing pickleball for 3 month so i'm definitely still a beginner. i am 27 year old for context. i have been playing with a few different group and only happened upon the sport because i saw people playing when i wa walking my dog. i honestly wasn't aware of the sport at all. i love pickleball and feel like it is a perfect match for me a a sport. i feel like i had to fight to be included in these groups, because i had to ask after playing for a month to be included on an email list that i didn't even know existed when i first started playing. i want this sport to grow, and people always talk about wanting to get younger player out there. it just seems like no one is actively pursuing this. the first group i played with seemed very exclusive, and i wa referred to a the young guy, or kid a lot. i understand it, but it is frustrating to feel like the odd person out in a group when everyone ha the same common interest in pickleball. the second group i started playing with is much more inviting and inclusive, but i am still the young guy by far. i understand the nature of this sport, and i understand that it is attractive to an older audience. it is just frustrating that i never see another person within 10 year of my age out there playing. i tell my friend about it and they think it funny that i play because to them pickleball is only for old people, which is the whole perception that i would like to see shifted. i am by no mean saying that i don't want to play with people of all ages. i am just frustrated that it isn't really people of all ages. i am playing exclusively with people who are 40 or older. i feel like most of my frustration would be solved by having an advanced skill group that play separately from the other groups, but there aren't enough people playing in my area for that to be possible.",1509300565

you and your partner start at the baseline. you serve to your partner, they return, and you perform a third shot. this time instead of calling the ball dead, your partner give you a return shot and you must place the ball back(on your fifth shot) into the kitchen. **fifth shot drill** *continuous* * you do everything the same a the drill above, but your partner try to keep you back off the line. you must then work your way all the way to the kitchen line. if you want to play out the remainder of the point from the kitchen line you can, but your first objective is to get up there. **mid court volley** * this is getting up in level of play, but is an important skill to have when trying to move up to the kitchen line. your partner stand at the kitchen line and you stand around mid court or *no man's land*. your partner then feed you the ball around knee/waist/chest height. you then work on taking the ball out of the air and volley it back into the kitchen. **fifth shot with walk back** * again, for more advance players.you do the fifth shot drill and once you make it up to the kitchen line you begin to slowly move backwards all the way to the baseline while continuing to make your shot into the kitchen. **fifth shot with lob** * this is getting up there in skill, so take your time getting to this drill. you do the fifth shot drill and once you are up at the kitchen you lob your partner to the baseline, they run back, return the lob, and then proceed to work their way back up to the kitchen. **please notice at this point is only drill to make it up to the kitchen line. this is the most dominant position in pickleball and an important skill to master** **dink count** * this is a simple drill where you and your partner dink in the kitchen a many time a possible while counting. start straight across from each other and work your way up to be able to do cross court dinking. try from different position around the court and do your best to beat your score each time! **dink around the kitchen** * you and your partner start straight across from each other and slowly move sideways down the court while dinking the ball from one end to the other. once you are able to move all the way to the other side of the court, try to come back! great to work footwork around the kitchen line. **dink count with movement** * this requires you to be able to dink cross court on both your forehand and backhand side. you do the dink count drill, but after 10 or 20 hits, either you or your partner quickly move to the other side of the court. this is to practice court movement, being able changing ball location quickly, and focus on ball placement. **tethering** * this skill is key for successful team in pickleball. act like you and your partner have a string attached at the ankle and where ever they go, you go. you and your partner should only have 6'' to 1' between each other's wingspan at any moment. this skill help you effectively cover the entire court without leaving hole on the court for your opponent to score. the easiest way to practice this is to get 4 people and do the dink count drill and focus on spacing between you and your partner. **kitchen volley** * this is an easy skill to practice, but a hard skill to master. do the dink count drill and let your partner drive some shot down to your feet. practice reaching out into the kitchen and taking the volley in the air and placing it back into the kitchen before they get to your feet. **drop shots/blocking** * have a hard time against people that bang the ball from the baseline or close to the net? prevent it! step 1 is to remember to always keep your paddle up in front of you. step 2 is learning how to deaden their shot and put it right back in the kitchen. you stand at the kitchen line while your partner stand at the baseline. have your partner drive a hard, flat shot into your mid section. practice blocking the ball and putting it back into the kitchen. **attacking/fast game** * you and your partner start at mid court and begin to volley the ball. keep the ball in the air and slowly move up to the kitchen line continuing to volley the ball. once you are established, practice attacking and blocking while keeping the ball in the air. some key thing to remember is to keep your paddle out in front of you, keep the ball flat or moving downhill, and don't retreat from the line once you are established to give your partner a better angel to attack you. **reseting the point** * an important part of the fast game is realizing when you are losing it. you start off the same way a the attacking/fast game drill, but after 5 quick exchanges, no matter where the ball is, you must try to block and reset the point back into the kitchen. use this skill when the other team ha the downward angel while attacking you. **jump around the kitchen kill shot drill** * for advance players. there is a technical name for this shot that i can not remember at this time. begin dinking with your partner and have them hit a shot back over the high part of the net. practice footwork jumping around the kitchen without faulting for the kill shot. this skill is important to have presence of the court and to change the pace of the game. **around the post shot** * for advance players. just a in ping pong, when you are sent out wide, the ball doesn't have to go over the net. your partner stand close to the net and throw or feed a ball out wide past the post. you stand at the kitchen line, follow the ball out wide, and drive the ball back into the court. *note - it is important to let the ball drop to it's lowest point before striking the ball.* **defending the around the post shot** * for advance players. your partner stand on the outside of the court and strike the ball a if going around the net. you follow them outside of the court and block/volley the ball back into the kitchen. i'm sure there are plenty more drill and feel free to post them here! these are just a few that my partner and i have been practicing to improve our game that i wanted to pas along with the rest of you. enjoy!!",1479056433

1834,pickleball,"new player, grip circumference question","**(tl;dr : new player, which paddle do i order? etc)** hey yall, i'm working on being le sedentary and getting a modicum of fitness. raw exercise is really boring and most sport don't engage me. i've been down to the local pickleball court now a couple of time and borrowed spare paddles. i think this could be what i'm looking for. i think it's time to buy my first paddle. ##main question## i've been looking at information regarding paddle online. i've always thought of my hand a medium/large (male), certainly not huge. an online sizing chart i printed out put my ideal grip at 4.5"" (large). using random object at home, i found a 4.5"" aspirin bottle that let me test the off-hand-finger sizing trick. (not real accurate, sure, but it's all i've got; the ring-finger palm-crease method tell me 5.25 -- i've got to be doing that wrong.) there's only one local store that ha a small selection of non-wood paddles, and half of them are packaged to prevent holding their grips. all but one had 4"" grips. the 4 1/8"" grip felt subtly better. i think i'll order online, but i still haven't gotten a good feel for what grip to order. do i order a 4.25, or one of the very few 4.5s? how well do grip tape work for bulking a grip? can you even go from 4.25 to 4.5 with grip tape? do they subtract from the feel and control of the grip? am i overthinking this and should just settle with any old 4""? why do they sell so many paddle with 4"" grips? ##related questions## it's been about a decade since i've enjoyed low-skill badminton, some of which is translating to pickleball. my guess is that i want a medium/slightly-light weight paddle, high elasticity (pop?), and a full length grip. with at least one paddle, i kept hitting the top of the net (underestimating the give of the paddle). because i'm so new, i'm not sure how my game will adjust and progress over time. maybe i only think i want those things? because i haven't been able to try a wide selection of paddle on court, i'm having a hard time gauging the different core and faces. also, because i don't have a lot of cash, and because i might not make a great purchase the first time, i'm curious about used paddle and factory second (from reputable sites). are those a safe a they seem? speaking of which, are there site that are particularly recommended, or should be avoided? anything else that i should have asked, but didn't? thanks!",1476907418

1973,pickleball,happy birthday 50th pickleball,"happy birthday 50th pickleball , learn from from history born in the summer of 1965, pickleball turn 50 this year. happy birthday! sport do some interesting thing around the age of 50. i would argue that it‚Äôs really when the third generation of athlete play the game. for some perspective let me mention what happened to other sport at this age; football, due to death and popularity wa commissioned by the president to change drastically. the forward pas wa made legal and the game ha become the most popular in america. baseball, established a world series, and set the game on a stage for the best known athlete of the century, babe ruth. skyrocketing with the invention of radio a a mean to broadcast this ‚Äúbabe‚Äù, a larger than life image. tennis is maybe the most interesting. although it wa played for hundreds, possibly in some form, thousand of years. but once the rubber bouncy ball wa created in mass by mr. goodyear, the game wa played by the common man overnight. within 50 year top athlete began to play the game, not just the elite. then the major were formed a well a the davis cup. it would not be long until neighborhood throughout the usa had tennis courts. so what do i think pickleball can learn from history; a baseball had the radio, you have the internet. and so far i truly believe that the seniors, who may have gone out of their comfort zone at first , have used the internet to expose youth player to coaching and the solid fundamentals. i really respect what this generation ha done for the game. this should be encourage to the highest degree possible. at some point, someone will figure out something about the game that make it more advantageous to an athlete with superior ability. it will be resisted at first, the same player that have played the same way for so long will not like it. but it may bring the marquee athlete into the game. is a softball windmill type serve? maybe something to do with no volley-line? maybe large cash prizes? i just know that if you currently care about the game, you will probably not embrace it at first, unless it the cash. then you probably want that, but just remember it took football almost 100 year to completely embrace the forward pass. but this next, third generation, is so unique. these player will be both 30 -50, a well a 0-12 creating the potential for the largest group coming to the game at one time. thanks to the effort of senior players, or the ‚Äúfirst generation‚Äù, court are beginning to get built specifically for pickleball, middle school and high school curriculum are adding this game, tournament are popping up all over the country, there is even a national championship. i used to order paddle from some retired air force member how somehow flattened airplane part ( i never really understood this process), now you can buy a paddle at sporting good stores, but more than likely you shop at one of the hundred of online stores, and you have dozen of options. in 2007, if i wanted to go to a tournament, the only one on i could find within a 12 hour drive wa at a nudist campground. this year there were 8 within a 2 hour drive. but what doe it mean for pickleball? it should continue to bloom. my advice would be to keep doing what you do, continue reaching out using the social media. reach to the younger side of the game, embrace the 30-50 that will be coming. be open to the change that may come and when your larger than life player come around, be ready to learn. be prepared for the next group coming in, you will recognize them when they say, ‚Äúwhy do you call it pickleball.?",1440174560
