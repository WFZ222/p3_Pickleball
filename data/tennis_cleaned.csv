196,tennis,novak djokovic comment on bob green interview ( one of the founder of atp ),"with atp i think we have somewhere between 25-30% a average of what player get from the tournaments. that's for atp. when it come to grand slams, the average is half of that, maybe around 11-12%, if nothing changed in the last 2 years.some change did happen, in term of absolute prize money number (not really in the last 2 year because of covid), it doe go in the direction of increase, but... the medium keep on writing about how the player get more prize money, but they don't write about how much the revenue ha increased for the tournaments. in percentages, that increase is much much higher than what wa passed to the players. it's really a touchy subject in our sport. i wa never reluctant to talk about it, i think it's very important. i know that it's uncomfortable subject for many tournaments, people in the politics and business of tennis, those who do not want certain information to be made public for the player to find out about how the business is organized. that's really the biggest reason why ptpa is founded, why such an organization need to exist. we don't have any other 100% player body to represent them and their rights. no matter how much i do respect atp, they have their good side without a doubt, but the system doe not work, we've seen that many time in the past. i wa in the council for nearly 10 years, so i really know how much we have tried, but it simply doesn't work. for the player to be able to really make a bigger change for their life and bigger step forward, it really need to be done through an organization that is solely focused on representing the players. otherwise, we are just running in circles. unfortunately, the player have their priority in training and excelling at tennis, and the other side (tournaments and tennis politicians) have their priority in these thing (earnings) - so there is already a huge gap (for any negotiations). many thing are being done that are not in the player interest. i hope that those who are not in ptpa today will start to recognize this problem. there are many top player who still haven't joined. i'm sorry about that, but i can understand that everyone need time to think about it, maybe they'll support it, maybe not. the more time passes, there is le time to make some concrete change, because in the meantime new rule are being passed. for example, the new 30-year period contract, the 30 year licence extension for all the masters, that's really crazy. that's not being done in any other sport - to give a 30 year guarantee to anyone, it's unbelievable. and then f.e. from those licences, that will go double in price because of the extra day of tournament organization, they sell the licence for hundred of million of euros, and the player get nothing. and we (the players), a part of atp, have enabled all of that - longer tournaments, 30year licences, but we don't get anything from selling those rights. that's just one example, and there are lot of similar red flag for the player in that new deal. only if the big majority of the player get together, especially the top players, we can make some actual change. if we continue like we are doing now, we are just running in circles, and that work for the benefit of those who have the monopoly.",1637282382

266,tennis,wta appreciation post,"a the wta final conclude, i'd like to take a moment and appreciate how well the wta is run and how much more exciting it is becoming day by day. for starters, their decision to move the tournament to mexico wa at first criticized. people talked about the altitude, the balls, the fact that it wa an outdoor tournament etc. however, it wa a resounding success with incredible crowd support, great match and memorable stories. i'm sure they will seriously consider increasing the number of tournament in latam. a i've written in another post, the tour is often criticized for lack of dominance and consistency, sometimes rightly so. however, you can see how important depth is by comparing the wta and atp final so far. with rafa and roger out, the tournament ha been very forgettable so far. sure, the withdrawal of tsitsipas and berrettini made it worse, but without disrespecting the other players, i doubt that ruud v norrie is what people expect at the most exclusive tournament of the season. on the other hand, the wta final were full of exciting matches, a large number of player that are evenly matched and that's why there were many surprises. lastly and most importantly i want to acknowledge the spine that simon and the tour have shown in the horrid peng shuai situation. of course no one should realistically expect that a tennis organization will seriously influence the chinese government. taking tournament away from china will impact the wta much more than the government of china, but that's exactly the point. they are taking a stance to protect their player and they didn't cave after the dubious announcement. overall the tour is doing a great job and it's clearly evident.",1637221390

280,tennis,"interesting fact: not a single member of the ""big 3"" ever won the ""atp finals"" in it current form/name/branding","the ""atp tour finals"" changed multiple form and brendings since it inception in 1970. it's very first edition for example, wa callled the ""masters grand prix"" (pepsi-cola master for sponsorship purposes) and it featured six players, each competing against each other in a ""round robin"" format where the one with most win after 5 game wa crowdned the champion (stan smith won it with 4-1 record, just like rod laver. however stan smith defeated rod laver in the h2h match) the format changed soon after, but the official ""name""/""branding"" for the final atp tournament stayed the same - **masters grand prix** this wa the case until 1990 when it changed the name to **atp tour world championships** the start of the 2000s meant a new change for the final tournament on the atp tour. starting with the year 2000, this tournament wa known a **tennis master cup** this wa the case until 2009 where it wa renamed to **atp world tour finals**. interestingly, the 2009 tournament had the big 4! murray, federer, djokovic and murray! all 4 split in 2 different groups. nadal and djokovic were together in one group....and...both were eliminated! soderling and davydenko advanced from that group! from the other group...murray wa eliminated in the group! only federer advanced to the semis.....and he lost to davydenko! the reason why i am saying this is that.... from 2006 to the start of the new ""branding"" of the tournament every single winner wa one of the ""big 4"" other than....davydenko, in 2009. 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011 were the year when federer won the tournament. 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 were the year when djokovic won the title, and in 2016 - andy murray won it. but let's move on. after the ""atp world tour finals"" - it wa time for another rebranding. in 2017, the atp did another rebranding. this time, the tournament wa only known as.... **atp finals** simple name, but the result were anything but simple! since then, the 2021 edition will be the 5th editon of ""atp finals"", but in the previous 4... not a single member of the big 3 managed to win it! here's what happened: **2017**: nadal and federer were the only one representing ""the goats"" nadal played only one match and lost before withdrawing due to injury. federer defeated sock (2-0), cilic (2-1) and zverev (2-1) to advance to the semi with the perfect score of 3-0! however, in the semi-finals he wa stunned! he lost 2-1 in set to goffin, after winning the first set 6-2. he lost the next two 3-6;4-6. dimitrov defeated goffin in the final to become the first champion of ""atp finals"" **2018:** another year with one of the ""big 3"" missing. this time it wa nadal not being part of the tournament. djokovic started the group stage with 3 win and not a single lost set! he defeated cilic, isner and zverev 2-0! federer won two match and lost one in the group stage. federer defeated thiem and anderson 2-0, and lost 2-1 to nishikori. novak and federer avoided each other in the semi since both won their groups. novak djokovic defeated anderson 6-2;6-2. federer lost 5-7;6-7 to zverev, thus robbing u of the third final between the two at the ""atp's final tournament of the year"" (for the record, they played in the final at 2015 and 2012 with novak winning 2-0, and roger withdrew before the 2014 finals) in the final of the 2018 edition of the atp finals... novak lost! zverev won 6-4;6-3! **2019:** finally, the gang's all here! the best chance that the ""big 3"" had at winning the atp finals! nadal had the luck(?) of avoiding novak and roger in the group stage... ...but i am not sure if that's luck a he wa eliminated in the group stage. despite..winning two matches! nadal defeated tsitsipas and medvedev (both 2-1) and lost 2-0 to zverev. the won-lost set were not in his favour so he failed to qualify for the semis. in the other group... djokovic wa eliminated! novak defeated berretini (2-0), lost to thiem (1-2) and... lost to roger! (0-2) other than the win v novak, federer also defeated berretini (2-0) and lost to thiem (0-2) in the semi - federer lost to tsitsipas 2-0! in the eventual final, tsitsipas defeated thiem 2-1. **2020:** we are back to one of them missing. this time federer wa the only one who wa not there. novak lost to medvedev (0-2) but win against zverev (2-0) and schwartzman (2-0) helped him qualify for the semis. in the other group, nadal lost 0-2 (6–7^(7–9), 6–7^(4–7)) to thiem but he defeated tsitsipas 2-1 and rublev 2-0. both nadal and djokovic finished second in their group. they avoided each other in the semi and the scene wa set. novak. rafa. one win away from the great finals. aaand.... medvedev defeated nadal 2-1 and thiem defeated novak 2-1... in the eventual final, medvedev defeated thiem 2-1. 2021, mark the first year since the rebraning of ""atp finals"" where there's only one member of the ""big 3"" present at it - novak djokovic. we'll see if he'll manage to win it or if we'll see another big upset.",1637207841

350,tennis,the biggest implication of 40-15 is yet to come,if djokovic end up having a 3+ g lead over federer then 40-15 would effectively have no impact on the goat outcome at least a far a federer is concerned. i think it is quite likely that djokovic will in fact win at least 3 more g in his career with federer not adding anything more. so even if federer had won wimbledon 2019 he wa still not really assured of being goat. however what he would have guaranteed himself wa to be the grass goat decisively. there wa simply zero chance djokovic would ever get to 9 wimbledon title if he lost in 2019. however now i would say he is quite likely to end up with 8 wimbledon title which is all he need to do to become the grass goat. if he can win in 2022 which he is the clear favourite for then you bet djokovic would have grass goathood in his sights. we know he will give his everything to achieve it given how much he is motivated by history. and that in my opinion would be the biggest blow to federer's legacy to not be the best at any surface.,1637159044

382,tennis,new interview with federer (swiss media),"for english below #x200b; **die tenniswelt spekuliert, wann sie zurückkehren, ob man sie bereits am australian open wieder sieht. wa ist der stand der dinge?** die wahrheit ist, das ich unglaublich überrascht wäre, wenn ich in wimbledon (ab dem 27. juli 2022) schon wieder spielen würde. australien kommt überhaupt nicht infrage. da ist aber auch keine überraschung für mich. bereits vor der operation wussten wir, das danach eine monatelange pause nötig würde. ich wollte den ersten grossen check-up der ärzte abwarten, bevor ich mich öffentlich äussere, und der war nun sehr ermutigend. ich habe einen längeren rehabilitationsprozess begonnen, in den ich mein ganzes herzblut stecke. e ist nun einmal so, das die situation nicht mit der von 2016 zu vergleichen ist. ich mus geduldig sein, meinem knie zeit geben, damit e sich zu 100 prozent erholen kann. **in der kollektiven vorstellung ist ein meniskus schnell geheilt. man erinnert sich an pirmin zurbriggen, den italienischen fussballer franco baresi oder ihr linkes knie. warum dauert e diesmal rechts so lange?** die untersuchungen nach der rasensaison ergaben, das mein rechter innenmeniskus erneut verletzt war. er musste genäht werden, wa eine gewisse zeit der ruhigstellung bedingte. und die ärzte nutzten die gelegenheit, um auch meinen knorpel zu behandeln. die kombination dieser beiden eingriffe erfordert geduld und vorsicht. deshalb konnte ich mein bein nicht belasten, al ich an krücken ging. ich hätte diese operation auf jeden fall durchführen müssen, um mein langfristiges wohlergehen zu sichern. e handelt sich um einen wiederherstellenden eingriff. in diesem sinne ist er wichtiger al die operationen im jahr 2020 (ebenfalls am rechten knie), die primär darauf abzielten, meine beschwerden zu lindern, die ich seit einigen jahren mit mir herumgeschleppt hatte. #x200b; **sind die unterschiedlichen auswirkungen auf ihr rechtes und ihr linkes knie auf die unterschiedliche belastung bei den grundschlägen zurückzuführen?** da ist meine vermutung, aber man kann e nicht mit sicherheit sagen. die tatsache, das ich die vorhand au dem offenen stand und die rückhand au dem geschlossenen stand schlage, wobei die hauptlast auf dem rechten knie liegt, hat sicherlich eine rolle gespielt. ich hatte eigentlich immer da gefühl, das mein rechtes knie koordinativ besser ist. ich spürte e in den übungen mit pierre (paganini, seinem fitnesstrainer), e hält mehr aus. e ist da reaktionsschnellere der beiden knie. ich spiele ja auch mit dem rechten fuss fussball. zweifellos hat die zusätzliche belastung dazu geführt, das da rechte knie auf dauer mehr gelitten hat. #x200b; **wie sieht ihr zeitplan für ihre rückkehr auf die tour aus?** die ärzte sagen, das ich im januar wieder leicht joggen und allmählich auf den court zurückkehren kann. sanft. (lacht) sie wissen e nicht, aber ich habe schon ein bisschen tennis mit den kindern gespielt… im märz oder april kann ich dann wieder mit einem tennisähnlichen training beginnen, mit ausfallschritten und komplexeren bewegungen. und natürlich mus ich die gesamte kondition wieder aufbauen, die für tennis auf sehr hohem niveau notwendig ist. derzeit rechne ich damit, das ich im sommer 2022 zurückkehren kann. die nächsten vier oder fünf monate sind entscheidend. im frühling werde ich schon viel klarer sehen. **mit welchen ambitionen möchten sie im sommer auf die tour zurückkehren?** bevor ich darauf antworte, möchte ich sagen, das ich diese operation machen liess, um in den kommenden jahren und jahrzehnten mit meinen kindern skifahren oder mit meinen freunden fussball oder tennis spielen zu können. meine primäre motivation war es, mich für mein normales leben wieder in form zu bringen. aber ich wollte diese anspruchsvolle rehabilitation mit der mentalität und dem körper eines spitzensportlers angehen. wäre da zwei, drei jahre nach meinem rücktritt auch noch möglich? ich wei e nicht. wa meine sportlichen ambitionen angeht, könnte man die so zusammenfassen: ich möchte noch einmal sehen, wa ich al tennisprofi leisten kann. ich kämpfe dafür und bin sehr motiviert. ich spüre die unterstützung meines team und meiner familie. wir alle wünschen uns, das ich mich auf meine weise und auf einem tenniscourt verabschieden kann. **steht für sie der abschied auf dem court im vordergrund?** ja, und wenn man e genau nimmt, macht e keinen grossen unterschied, ob ich 2022 oder erst 2023 zurückkehre, mit 40 oder 41 jahren. da ist egal. die frage ist vielmehr: werde ich e schaffen, mich für mein comeback nochmals tag für tag zu quälen? mein herz sagt heute ja. also gehe ich die dinge schritt für schritt an. ich habe ähnliche herausforderungen in meiner karriere schon oft erlebt. manchmal ohne das e der öffentlichkeit bewusst war. und obschon ich weiss, das da ende nah ist, möchte ich versuchen, nochmals ein paar grosse spiele zu bestreiten. e wird nicht leicht sein, aber ich werde e probieren. **man könnte ihre fan in zwei kategorien einteilen: in jene, die nicht hinschauen können, einen roger federer zu sehen, der keine grossen titel mehr gewinnt. und in jene, die einfach froh sind, wenn sie wieder spielen. verstehen sie diesen gegensatz?** (er überlegt) ich bin ja auch ein grosser sportfan und finde, das da jeder athlet für sich selbst entscheiden soll. e gibt nicht den richtigen zeitpunkt, um abzutreten. sondern nur den zeitpunkt, der für jeden einzelnen sportler passt. e ist eine sehr persönliche entscheidung. wa für ein bild werden die leute von mir in erinnerung behalten? meinen letzten satz in wimbledon im vergangenen juli? oder meine grand-slam-titel und wa e bei ihnen auslöste, al sie mir beim spielen zugesehen haben? ich tippe auf zweiteres. seit einigen jahren bin ich in dieser hinsicht ziemlich entspannt. aber ich verstehe die gefühle der fans. und ihretwegen habe ich sie angerufen, um offen zu reden. meine fan haben e verdient, meine gefühle und hoffnungen zu verstehen. e wäre für mich einfach, zu sagen: «es ist okay, ich habe viel gegeben und viel erhalten. hören wir hier auf.» aber das ich alles investiere, um nochmals zurückzukommen, ist auch meine art, mich bei meinen fan zu bedanken. sie haben besseres verdient al da bild, da meine letzte rasensaison hinterlassen hat. **apropos rasen: trotz ihres meniskusrisses erreichten sie den viertelfinal in wimbledon. ist da in ihrer situation nicht ein ermutigendes zeichen?** ich spürte schon in halle gegen felix auger-aliassime, das mein wimbledon nicht da sein würde, wa ich mir erhofft hatte. auch wenn ich die art meiner verletzung noch nicht kannte, wusste ich, das ich eingeschränkt sein würde. aber wenn du alles auf ein turnier ausrichtest – so wie wahrscheinlich auch rafa (nadal) in roland garros –, ist e normal, die probleme beiseitezuschieben und alles zu geben. ausserdem hoffst du immer auf ein wunder. e gibt immer eine kleine chance… wa wäre passiert, wenn ich da tiebreak de zweiten satzes gegen hurkacz gewonnen hätte? wenn du angeschlagen bist, klammerst du dich an alles: an deine früheren siege, deine erfahrung auf rasen. im nachhinein stellte ich fest, das ich in wimbledon fast keinen punkt gewonnen hatte, wenn ich mich hatte verteidigen müssen. aber ja, diesis wimbledon bestätigte mir, das ich trotz meiner einschränkung immer noch auf hohem niveau spielen konnte. und wenn man bedenkt, wie weit ich kam, da mus ich e einfach nochmals versuchen. **sie sagten eingangs, das sie nicht glauben, das sie 2022 in wimbledon antreten werden. wird man sie an grand slam nochmals brillieren sehen?** wenn ich meine rehabilitation intensiv betreibe, dann besteht die chance, das ich nochmals auf ein hohes niveau zurückkomme. wenn ich krafttraining mache, aufs velo gehe, schwimme, gleichgewichtsübungen mache, an meinem oberkörper arbeite, dann glaube ich daran. ob ich für eine kleinere runde auf die tour zurückkehre oder für etwas grösseres? niemand wei das, weder die ärzte noch ich. aber ich kämpfe dafür. um e klar zu sagen: meine welt wird nicht zusammenbrechen, wenn ich nie wieder einen grand-slam-final bestreite. aber e ist mein ultimativer traum, nochmals zurückzukehren. und tatsächlich glaube ich immer noch daran. ich glaube an diese art von wunder. ich habe sie schon erlebt. die sportgeschichte schreibt manchmal solche wunder. ich bin realistisch: e wäre ein gross wunder. aber im sport gibt e wunder. #x200b; #x200b; **translation** **the tennis world is speculating when you will return, whether you will already be seen at the australian open. what is the state of play?** the truth is that i would be incredibly surprised if i were to play again at wimbledon (from july 27, 2022). australia is out of the question at all. but that's not a surprise for me either. even before the operation, we knew that a month-long break would be necessary afterwards. i wanted to wait for the first major check-up by the doctor before i made a public statement, and that wa very encouraging. i have started a longer rehabilitation process in which i put all my heart and soul. the fact is that the situation cannot be compared to 2016. i have to be patient, give my knee time to recover 100 percent. **in the collective mind, a meniscus heals quickly. people remember pirmin zurbriggen, the italian footballer franco baresi, or your left knee. why is it taking so long on the right this time?** the examination after the grass season revealed that my right medial meniscus wa injured again. it had to be stitched, which required a period of immobilization. and the doctor took the opportunity to treat my cartilage a well. the combination of these two procedure requires patience and caution. that's why i couldn't put any weight on my leg when i wa on crutches. i definitely should have had this surgery to ensure my long-term well-being. it is a restorative surgery. in that sense, it is more important than the surgery i had in 2020 (also on my right knee), which were primarily aimed at relieving discomfort i had been carrying around for several years. #x200b; **are the different effect on your right and left knee due to the different loading on the groundstrokes?** that's my guess, but it's impossible to say for sure. the fact that i hit the forehand from an open stance and the backhand from a closed stance, with the main load on the right knee, certainly played a role. i actually always felt that my right knee wa better coordination-wise. i felt it in the exercise with pierre (paganini, his fitness trainer), it hold up more. it's the more responsive of the two knees. i also play soccer with my right foot. there's no doubt that the extra strain ha meant that the right knee ha suffered more in the long run. #x200b; **what is your timetable for your return to the tour?** the doctor say i'll be able to jog lightly again in january and gradually return to the court. gently. (laughs) they don't know it, but i've already been playing a little tennis with the kids... then in march or april i can start training again in a tennis-like way, with lunge and more complex movements. and of course, i need to rebuild all the conditioning that is necessary for tennis at a very high level. currently, i expect to be able to return in the summer of 2022. the next four or five month are crucial. in the spring, i will already see thing much more clearly. **with what ambition do you want to return to the tour in the summer?** before i answer that, i would like to say that i had this operation done so that i could ski with my child or play soccer or tennis with my friend in the year and decade to come. my primary motivation wa to get back in shape for my normal life. but i wanted to approach this demanding rehabilitation with the mentality and body of a top athlete. would that still be possible two or three year after my retirement? i don't know. a far a my sporting ambition are concerned, they could be summed up like this: i would like to see once again what i can achieve a a professional tennis player. i'm fighting for it and i'm very motivated. i feel the support of my team and my family. we all wish that i can say goodbye in my own way and on a tennis court. #x200b; **is saying goodbye on the court the main thing for you?** yes, and when you get right down to it, it doesn't make much difference whether i return in 2022 or 2023, at the age of 40 or 41. it doesn't matter. the question is rather: will i manage to torture myself again day after day for my comeback? my heart say yes today. so i'm taking thing step by step. i have experienced similar challenge many time in my career. sometimes without the public being aware of it. and even though i know that the end is near, i want to try to play some big game again. it won't be easy, but i'll give it a try. **you could divide your fan into two categories: those who can't look at seeing a roger federer who doesn't win any more big titles. and into those who are just happy to see you playing again. do you understand this contrast?** (he think about it) i'm a big sport fan, too, and i think that every athlete should decide for himself. there is no right time to retire. there is only the time that suit each individual athlete. it's a very personal decision. what kind of image will people remember of me? my last set at wimbledon last july? or my grand slam title and what it triggered in them when they watched me play? my money is on the latter. for a few year now, i've been pretty relaxed about that. but i understand the fans' feelings. and it wa because of them that i called you to talk frankly. my fan deserve to understand my feeling and hopes. it would be easy for me to say, ""it's okay, i've given a lot and received a lot. let's stop here."" but the fact that i'm investing everything i have to come back once again is also my way of saying thank you to my fans. they deserve better than the image my last grass season left. **speaking of grass: despite your meniscus tear, you reached the quarterfinal at wimbledon. isn't that an encouraging sign in your situation?** i already felt in halle against felix auger-aliassime that my wimbledon would not be what i had hoped for. even though i didn't know the nature of my injury yet, i knew i would be limited. but when you set everything up for a tournament - a rafa (nadal) probably did at roland garros - it's normal to put your problem aside and give everything. besides, you always hope for a miracle. there's always a small chance... what would have happened if i had won the tiebreak of the second set against hurkacz? when you're battered, you cling to everything: your previous victories, your experience on grass. in retrospect, i realized that i almost didn't win a point at wimbledon when i had to defend. but yes, that wimbledon confirmed to me that i could still play at a high level despite my limitation. and considering how far i got, i just have to try again. **you said at the beginning that you don't think you'll be competing at wimbledon in 2022. will we see you shine again at grand slams?** if i do my rehabilitation intensively, then there is a chance that i will return to a high level. if i do strength training, go on the bike, swim, do balance exercises, work on my upper body, then i believe in it. will i return to the tour for a smaller round or for something bigger? nobody knows, neither the doctor nor me. but i'm fighting for it. to be clear, my world will not collapse if i never play another grand slam final. but it is my ultimate dream to return once again. and in fact, i still believe in it. i believe in these kind of miracles. i have already experienced them. sport history sometimes writes such miracles. i am realistic: it would be a great miracle. but there are miracle in sports.",1637135630

731,tennis,depth analysis by country - part 2,"i posted a chart earlier today that attempted to analyze which country had the greatest player depth. it wa a bit confusing, so i decided to try a different approach. user ""special-vegetable138"" suggested using ""cross country style"" scoring, which mean you add up the ranking of each country's top ranked players, and lowest score wins. so for example if country x's top five player are ranked 2, 5, 10, 13, and 20, that country's score would be 2 + 5 + 10 + 13 + 20 = 50. it's a good idea, but the problem with that approach is, how do you decide how many player to factor into the ranking? for example, if you use 4 players, russia will dominate since it ha 4 player in the top 30. but if you use 10 players, russia fall far behind since their player quality fall off sharply after their #4 ranked player. so i ran the analysis 15 times, using each country's top 1 to 15 players. every country with at least one player in the top 200 is represented. player outside the top 1000 are not included. if a country did not have any additional player inside the top 1000, it did not get a rank. here are the results. i think there are some very interesting trend in here. a expected, the deepest country are usa, spain, france, and italy. russia, serbia, and canada have excellent player at the top, but not so much further down. of course, this is just a snap shot based on the current live rankings. this chart is constantly evolving a player move up and down the rankings. .png?width=1966format=pngauto=webps=71f715d7ae05b0d9986ce4c17439319293d97724",1636779567

891,tennis,next gen group b scenario matrix,"i love the round robin format because it can lead to wacky scenarios. many of you probably already know how this work but i thought i'd spell it all out, since we have some interesting possibility in next gen group b going into day 3. on day 2 of round robin play, day 1 winner play day 1 winner and day 1 loser play day 1 losers. so after 2 day you always wind up with one player at 2-0, one player at 0-2, and two player at 1-1. on day 3, player play whoever they haven't played yet. if the 0-2 player end up playing the 2-0 player (leaving the 1-1 player to play each other), the 2-0 player automatically advance and the 1-1 player are vying for the second place slot. this is the more boring outcome (e.g. group a where alcaraz is guaranteed to advance, and nakashima play rune for the second spot). but in about 50% of cases, you have the 2-0 player playing a 1-1 player, and the 0-2 player playing the other 1-1 player. in this case, we get the scenario matrix, i.e. a 6x6 table with each axis having the following possibilities: x win in 3, x win in 4, x win in 5, y win in 3, y win in 4, y win in 5. (thanks to user luck1492 for correctly pointing out in my deleted post that next gen is best of 5!) in half of the possible outcomes, you end up with a 3-way tie and the deciding factor is percentage of set won (or game if there's still a 3-way tie). in the current case, we end up with the following (color coded for each unique combination of players): .png?width=903format=pngauto=webps=61cc212d37aa9e6c5336f41b41d6360f9e128b93 a few notes: \-korda is guaranteed to advance unless baez win in 3 and musetti win in 3. \-gaston ha the most difficult path. he must win and musetti must lose in order for him to advance. \-baez and musetti both must win to advance, but a win doe not guarantee advancement. baez can guarantee advancement by winning in 3. \-the scenario with an asterisk have a 2-way tie for second place in percentage of set won. i believe those case are decided by head-to-head record but i'm not certain of that. \-baez vs. gaston is on first tomorrow. depending on the outcome, korda and musetti will know exactly what they need to do to advance. for example, suppose gaston win and korda decides he want to screw over gaston to help his buddy musetti. he can then throw his match against musetti, and both will still advance (but korda would have to play alcaraz in the semis). i did this pretty quick so i may have made a mistake. sorry if someone else already posted this, i always look forward to this scenario every year!",1636598351

""d\*\*n, my backhand wa so solid in last training! why is it so shitty today?!"" ""six double fault in one set? who am i? sascha zverev?!"" and so on... thanks to laura now i know that whenever i step on the court i am about to face struggle and that a match is not about playing perfect tennis but about overcoming adversity - be it the opponent, wind, sun, bad bounces, whatsoever. this mindset ha helped me keeping my composure and ultimately made me a better player. is there anything that had a similar impact on you?",1636570790

1020,tennis,don't hate on the wta for being le consistent,"a a big fan of both the atp and the wta i don't like when people automatically say women's tennis is boring. besides the level of tennis, many people allude to the fact that anyone can win a slam on a given period and there's absolutely no dominance on the tour. i think there are many thing one should point out when discussing this. first of all, in both tour there are cycle of dominance and relative parity. without needing to go so far back to evert, martina or graf and seles i think people forget that the wta used to be much more consistent 10 year ago. watching the williams sisters, sharapova, azarenka or kvitova wa expected in the last round of slam and it wasn't always the case that a raducanu or an ostapenko would win slams. also due to the absurd dominance of the big 4 in the atp people forget the men's tour wasn't always like this. late 90 and early 00s for example, you'd have many one or two time slam winner or short term no 1 (moya, kafelnikov, johansson, ríos to name a few). the fact that 5 people have won 3 slam plus in the last 20 year (roughly) is an anomaly and not the norm. another factor that isn't talked about enough in this context is the fact that women's slam are bo3. being fit to play long matches, being composed and mentally tough to close out or recover in a big match after 3 or 4 hour is a serious skill that differentiates legend from good player (just remember how many time rafa or nole have come back from the dead). furthermore, the longer a match, the lower the element of luck and the probability of an upset. i am certain that if slam were bo5 there would be fewer winner on the women's side and significantly more domination. one can think of how good zverev is in master's compared to gs. lastly there are significant difference between the duration and the peak of career of male and female tennis player that should not be discounted. i am not an expert, but i don't believe it's coincidence that many player like hingis, sharapova or seles had won multiple slam at 19, while this is hardly the case for men. woman peak earlier and a young champion is thought of being a sign of a weak tour. men probably take more time to develop physically and the game is more demanding. also they tend to have longer career (women might want to start a family or their body might not be able to bear this absurd load for too long). again, i don't know well the anatomical difference and their implication but these thing are not random. so to sum up, sure this is currently an era where there are many one hit wonder in the women's tour and the top player often struggle in big games. but one should remember it wasn't always like this neither for men, nor for woman and there are many reason that enable this phenomenon to take place. women's tennis is still exciting to watch i believe. sorry for the long post.",1636471923

1093,tennis,scenario for djokovic and medvedev in rr,"i'll assume tsitsipas won't retire from turin. so djokovic and medvedev are of course, on different groups, then the player that can't be in the same group are: number 3 and 4: zverev and tsitsipas number 5 and 6: rublev and berrettini number 7 and 8: hurkacz and ruud with the number 3 and 4 because of recent form (and worse considering injury) tsitsipas would be the preferable option for any of them, zverev, in spite of the 6-2 6-2 loss, is no joke for any of them and the 3 setter at the atp cup is probably a better indicator of a match against medvedev in the pretty much likely fast condition in turin, djokovic ha played zverev 4 time this year and none have been easy for any of them, he would pretty much avoid this match up in the first rounds. for number 5 and 6, while we haven't seen the rublev djokovic match up, i think rublev just doesn't have the weapon to hurt him. now, the good news for both djokovic and medvedev is that neither of the 5 and 6 have a particular good form right now, rublev ha been losing to opponent he shouldn't and berrettini can't get rhythm because of injuries, but given the match ups i'd believe medvedev would prefer berrettini, he dominated him in the atp cup and, while he could maybe take some clue from djokovic v medvedev match, doing more slices, going to the net, without match play it's hard to implement that successfully, also, because of rublev recent win over him which might give him confidence. djokovic would likely face rublev who is in bad form and who doesn't have the weapon to unfaze him, berrettini showed in wimbledon and rg that he can do damage with his game and given this is bo3 and with the motivation of being in italy he could trouble him. number 7 and 8 is clear for me, medvedev would pretty much avoid hurkacz who beat him at wimbledon and had the chance to beat him in canada, plus this is indoor hc which won't favour the heavy spin forehand of ruud compared to medvedev gamestyle, djokovic will likely want to avoid someone who probably got confidence from pushing him to a third set tiebreak last week also so ruud is the choice here. #x200b; if tsitsipas doe retire, i still believe any of them would prefer to face sinner, inexperienced, who definitely suffered from the pressure of trying to qualify to turin rather than facing zverev who won this title in 2018 and is in good form.",1636395940

1166,tennis,what if both player had to stand behind the service line while serving in doubles?,"a someone who love to play double recreationally, i'm always disappointed when i watch professional doubles. it's so just boring. most point are over in under 3 shots, and this is due to the massive advantage the serving side gets. a returner essentially ha to hit in the one third of their court court just to start the point off at a slight disadvantage. fail that and the point is over immediately. in fact, i calculated it: here are the percentage of set that went to tiebreaks in all the men's double grand slams: u open: 27.5% wimbledon. 26.1% french open: 19.5% australian open: 25.2% this is way too high in my opinion. so what if the rule wa changed that forced the serving parter to stay behind the baseline on the serve? after a return fall in, normal play resumes. double ha some of the most entertaining point in the rare case that it can going, and this rule change would help that out a lot. but i'm just a novice and semi invested fan, so who care what i think.",1636306761

1291,tennis,next gen of the week #10/final: jannik sinner,"[previous post](?utm_medium=android_apputm_source=share) well, here we are at the end of the season. a a special present, i'm actually doing this on time. while there are certainly surprise left in store, it time to commemorate a great year for one of the italian next gen: jannik sinner. - age: 20 - ranking: 10 - notable results: rg qf, miami f, 500 w - notable wins: zverev, tsitsipas, rublev - strengths: power, movement, composure - weaknesses: serve, variety, plan b to get it out of the way quickly, sinner absolutely slam the ball. he ha an easy power that only escalates a he gain rhythm in a rally. he ha a wonderful wrist lag on both wings, and really turn through his shots. he's already matching top player for power while far from his physical prime, which doesn't bode well for anyone that'll have to face him in the future. every shot just keep coming back faster and faster until eventually there's no way to return it. did you sinner used to be a skier? i certainly did due to overzealous commentators, but it show in his game. he ha an almost djokovic-esque balance, letting him take full swing at shot while in poor positions. this, combined with great footspeed, make him a defensive nightmare. even when opponent have him on the run, he still remains a huge threat, a any shot could suddenly be returned with interest. (as a personal aside, i do wonder if cross sport training will become more prevalent to try and develop specific talent like this.) a many picked up on during his first couple tournaments, sinner is remarkably calm. while he certainly isn't perfect under pressure, he's far ahead of the curve. maintaining a calm presence on court is one of the first step to creating doubt in your opponent. if they never see you get frustrated, they know you're always in the match. this is why i never understand why people think paire with a forehand would be a great - even if he had that shot, everyone know he's one meltdown away from giving up. one of the main factor holding sinner back currently is his serve. earlier in this season it wa his accuracy that wa the problem, but recently it become the consistency. it's impossible to tell when he'll actually be putting first serf in the box. in a game that is rapidly becoming dominated by giant with huge serves, this is a death sentence. if you can't match their hold rate, you're at an extreme disadvantage. luckily, he ha been improving. his serving throughout the indoor season ha been quite good, with a couple exceptions. what ha not improved is his variety. i can probably count the number of dropshots he's played this season on one hand, and his volley are just poor. quite a few of his loss can be attributed to this weakness; others have been able to draw him into cat and mouse game at net, which ha left him vulnerable. the concern continues to be whether this will be focus for him. it easy to ignore these a minor part of the game, but that neglect provides an avenue for weaker player to upset him. continuing with that lack of variety, sinner lack any real sort of plan b when he's having a poor day. his serve isn't good enough to carry him through matches, and his easy power make it hard to stay consistent when his timing is off. a is commonly said, the mark of a great is being able to win even when they aren't playing their best. sinner need to find that ability, because being unable to grind your way into form over the course of a tournament will kill far too many chance at big titles. more than likely, sinner will end up at the top of the game. his style is effective, his mentality is there, and the rate of improvement ha been amazing. i fully believe he can win 5 or possibly more slams, though a always nothing is a given. well, that's it for this year! i've had a great time writing these, and being able to discus with so many people. in between now and the start of next season i might start some other projects, though a always i'm open to suggestions. thanks for reading these everyone!",1636206571

it is true that i don't have evidence. it is also not possible to leave evidence. later on you kept denying, but it is true that you were attracted to me first, otherwise i couldn't have been able to come into contact with you. that afternoon i didn't agree, and i kept crying. i had dinner with you and auntie kang jie together. you said the universe is very very big. the earth is merely a speck of sand in the universe , and u human being are smaller than even a speck of sand. you said a lot more than that, and the purpose is basically to persuade me to lower my guard. after dinner, i wa still not willing to have sex. you said you hate me. you said in those seven years, you never forgot about me, and you will treat me well etc... i wa terrified and anxious. taking into consideration the affection i had for you seven year ago, i agreed... yes, we had sex. romantic attraction is such a complicated thing, can't explain it clearly. from that day on, i renewed my love for you. throughout my time with you after that, purely based on our interactions, you are a very good person, and you treated me well. we talking about recent history, a well a ancient eras. you educated me on so many topics, and we had discussion about economics, politics. we never ran out of thing to talk about. we played chess, sang, played table tennis, played pool and also played tennis together. we always had endless fun. it wa a if our personality fit perfectly together. i left home early (*translator note: professional athlete in china frequently leave their family at a very early age to train full-time*). on the inside, i am extremely deprived of love. in the middle of all of this, i never thought i wa a good woman. i hate myself, i hate why i came to this world. you told me you love me, very very much, and you said you hope in the next life, we can meet each other around the age of twenty, or eighteen. you said you were lonely. you pitied yourself for being alone. we had endless thing to talk about, never ran out of topics. you said in your position, it is impossible to divorce. if we met in shandong (*translator note: a province of china, of le political significance than beijing*), you would have been able to divorce, but not now. i thought i would just accompany you quietly, not making any noise. at the beginning, everything wa fine. but a time go on, thing started to change gradually. there wa so much unfairness and humiliation. every time you tell me to go to you home, behind your back your wife said so many ugly and hurtful thing to me. all kind of jeer and mockery. i said i like to eat duck tongue. auntie kang jie would go, ""ew so disgusting"". in the winter when beijing had poor air quality due to smog, auntie kang jie would say, ""it is because you live in the countryside. we don't feel that at all here"". thing like that, she said so much of them. when you were with me, she never said those things. it is similar to when we were together. when we were together alone, you acted one way, but when there were other people near by, you would act another way. i have told you this before, hearing those thing made me feel very hurt and humiliated deep down. since the first day when i knew you, i have never used a cent of your money, neither have i ever used you to obtain any benefit for myself, but this thing called reputation, is so important. everything that ha happened, i deserve it. i have brought everything upon myself. from the beginning to the end, you told me to keep our relationship a secret, and most importantly of all, i wa to never tell your mom we were having sexual relationships. because it wa her who drive me to the church of the saviour (*translator note: a church in beijing*) every time, and then i would have to change to your car to be able to get into the gated apartment complex. she thought i wa always just at your place to play mahjong or poker. we were always just transparent individual in each others lives. your wife wa like the queen in the legend of zhen huan (*translator note: a very popular show about royal drama in ancient china*), while word couldn't describe how embarrassed i felt. there were so many time where i thought, am i still a human? i thought i wa a soulless creature, faking, faking everyday, which one is the real me? i shouldn't have come to this world, but i don't have the courage to die. i really want to just live simply, but thing turned out different than what i wanted. on the 30th, we argued very badly. you said on the afternoon on the 2nd, we would go to your home to slowly talk it out. today at noon, you called to say you are busy, denied everything, made excuse to say we would talk another day... and just like this, you disappeared again, just like seven year ago. you played with me, and dumped me when you are done with me. you said there were no transaction between us. yes, that is true, our affection towards each other had nothing to do with money or power. but i have a hard time finding closure for, and coming to term with our three year long relationship. you were always scared i would secretly bring a recording device, and leave evidence. that's right, other than me, i do not have any evidence to prove what happened, no audio recording, no video taping. the only thing i have is memory from my own messed up self. for someone a prominent a yourself, i know you said you are not afraid. but it doesn't matter if i'm hitting a rock with an egg, or being a moth that fly towards the flame, i am telling the truth about what happened between us. with your intelligence and wit i am sure you will either deny it, or blame it on me, or you could simply play it cool. you always say you hope your mother in heaven could bless you. i am a bad woman who doesn't deserve to be a mother, but you are a father with both boy and girl. i have asked you this before, would you have done the same even to your adopted daughter?

despite that, there are a couple that are worth mentioning: **marta kostyuk** (ukraine; 19.4; 50): it's almost a surprise that kostyuk didn't make last year's list, a she wa surely among the most successful junior and wa threatening the top 100 last year. her junior record wa remarkable, winning the junior orange bowl in 2015, le petits a in 2016, the ausopen in 2017 aged 14, and quitting junior tennis altogether shortly after turning 15 to play exclusively on the adult tour. her first itf tournament win also came before her 15th birthday, and her second came in 2018, taking her to the verge of the top 100. in 2019, however, she slipped back, losing ranking point and failing to win any more titles, although a few decent run kept her in the top 150. a third itf title came in 2020. no more title since then, but this season ha seen kostyuk climb all the way to 51st, in large part due to deep run at abu dhabi, istanbul, and the french open (reaching the fourth round after beating muguruza), and last week at cluj where she made the sf. whilst kostyuk is still waiting for her maiden tour-level title, there's still no doubt that she's amongst the most promising young players. see also [this post](. **caty mcnally** (usa; 19.11; 145): mcnally make it onto this list primarily for her double career, which consists so far of ten title at all level (four at tour level), a well a two ausopen qfs and the 2021 u open final alongside coco gauff, all of which ha given her a double ranking of 21st. her single career ha been le prolific, with two itf title to her name, the most recent of which came two year ago, and she's not yet been able to match or improve upon her 2019 career-high ranking of 105th. still, if mcnally can continue her success at double that would also justify conclusion on this list. playing in midland this week. also, a brief shout-out to **amanda anisimova**, who only miss out a fuller entry by virtue of having turned 20 in august. the horrible tragedy of her father's sudden death two year ago ha clearly affected her; sign at indian well were that she wa back to enjoying tennis again, and here's hoping that she can rediscover her earlier form. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* now to player to look out for in the next couple of years. these first name are the one i'm most keen to write about, but of course this is very up in the air, so who know if i've made the right picks? ideally they've shown success at junior *and* adult/itf level. anyway, let's crack on. **zheng qinwen** (china; 19.1; 147): the third under-21 chinese player in the top 150, behind xiyu and xinyu wang, and coming of course from the same generation a such player a kostyuk, tauson, raducanu, and osorio serrano, all of whom she met at some point in her junior days. kostyuk thrashed her, but then again kostyuk wa thrashing most juniors! zheng made the junior orange bowl final in 2016, and the orange bowl final proper in 2018, losing to gauff on the latter occasion. so, a promising junior but behind many of the bigger names. on the other hand, her performance at itfs ha been pretty decent, especially post-pandemic. after the august 2020 restart, she won four tournament at the end of 2020, and her first in 2021. like most chinese players, continued covid restriction have affected her 2021 season, but she returned in may-june, and then in september. one more tournament win, and a couple of decent run elsewhere, have lifted her to the top 150. assuming she carry on, next season is likely to see her enter wta250s with more regularity. playing in nantes this week. **linda nosková** (czechia; 16.11; 315; j14): the fruhvirtova sister are just two of several young czech girl that are seriously promising tennis stars. there are six under-18 czech in the wta top 1000, and brenda fruhvirtova isn't even ranked yet. noskova is the highest of them, and also the second-highest under-18 in the rankings, behind gauff. some way behind gauff, to be sure, but then again that's because coco is exceptional. noskova herself isn't too bad, either. her first notable result is being the losing finalist to eala in the 2018 petits as, in an extremely tight match. her junior career includes four titles, the biggest being the 2021 french open. on the itf main tour, she's picked up three title this year so far, with other consistent result helping her to zoom up the ranking to 315th, having been outside the top 1000 at the start of 2021. look out for her in 2022 a she seek to build on that. **antonia ružić** (croatia; 18.9; 355): the 2021 european junior champion, and winner of three itf title since august, that sent her ranking up 400 places. the first of two croatian on this list, although i'm not sure if she's just tapped into a hot run of form or if this is indicative of something more promising. nevertheless, at that junior tournament, she beat linda fruhvirtova and elsa jacquemot, two other top juniors, and her performance at her last tournament included a first top-100 win, so she deserves to be regarded a part of the conversation of nextgen stars, even if she end up being a later bloomer than others in this generation. **sara bejlek** (czechia; 15.9; 375; j63): the second czech in this list, bejlek is also the second-youngest player in the top 1000. mainly due to her victory at an itf 60k, but she's (obviously) not played much adult-level tennis yet, and it's not like she's losing every other match she's playing: four other qf run at itf tournaments. will probably have at least one more season of mixing junior and itf events, so definitely one to look out for in the coming couple of seasons. my feeling is that 2022 will still be too early to expect much, but i'm intrigued by her potential. **matilda mutavdzic** (uk; 17.4; 448; j33): i have been in two mind about whether to mention matilda or not. i wa swayed ultimately by her performance in netanya two week ago, where she beat linda noskova in three set on her way to a second itf final of the year. the young brit is taking a more traditional route through tennis, currently mixing in itf tournament with juniors. her most notable result include the gold medal at the european youth olympics 2019 and a first itf title in 2020. still looking for a breakout result, but solid progress up the rankings, especially in the last month or so, and plenty of time to improve further still. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* now, some honourable mentions. player on this are either too young to be so easily noticed at the top level for some years, or haven't had success at top-level tournament but are still probably worth keeping an eye on regardless. **elsa jacquemot** (france; 18.5; 310; j7): the 2020 french open junior champion, this year mark her first serious full year of touring. a with some top junior it's been a difficult transition, but last week she reached the sf in the poitier w80, recording a second win over a top-100 player and lifting her into the top 350 for the first time. after doing the hard yard over the last couple of years, jacquemot may be ready to make a step up next season. **nikola bartůňková** (czechia; 15.8; 780; j32): youngest player in the top 1000, and yet another young czech star, but without so many eye-catching result just yet. won a high-level junior tournament last month. a an aside, it's seriously exciting to see so many young czech girl having potential to be future stars, and follow in the footstep of such recent star a the pliskova sister and kvitova! **petra marčinko** (croatia; 15.11; 902; j8): the second croatian on this list, marcinko is the third and final under-16 player in the top 1000. enjoyed a particularly brilliant 2019, winning five of her seven junior tournaments, and recently made the u open girls' single qf. last week, won the single and double title at the ja cape town tournament, one of the top junior tournament outside the slams, beating brenda fruhvirtova in the double final. started playing itf event this year, with two sf and two qf runs. **clervie ngounoue** (usa; 15.3; j24): 2018 u12 orange bowl champion, and finalist at the 2017 u12/2019 u16 orange bow, 2020 petits as, 2021 ja milan and ja cape town. ha lost a combined six time to the fruhvirtova sisters, often in high-profile junior finals, and ha a 2-2 rivalry going with marcinko (losing to her last week). despite this unenviable record against other top juniors, is one of the most promising u junior out there. ha played only a couple of adult-level tournament so far, with a couple of match win already. **daria egorova** (russia; 14.4; j427): way too early to know where egorova's future is going, but ha made an eye-catching start to her junior career, winning four straight tournament and 29 of her first 31 junior-level matches. yet to face any top juniors, and so far only playing in eastern europe, but look out for her in a couple of year or so. **hannah klugman** (uk; 12; n/a): an even longer shot, but a 12-year-old klugman's already winning match at high levels, reaching the 2021 petits a under-14 semis, and beating all-comers in an adult-level british tour event in may, a well a generally tearing it up in junior british tennis. finally, a few name i would like to mention in passing: **reese brantmeier**, who had a decent chance at qualifying for the u open this year; **katie volynets**, one of the top u junior whose name is made for tennis; **erika andreeva**, losing finalist at the 2021 french open, and with three itf titles, who is set to be the highest-ranked under-18 not yet mentioned on this list or the last one; and **mirra andreeva**, another 14-year-old prodigy and erika's younger sister, who won the 2019 u12 orange bowl and may well feature more prominently on next year's list. brantmeier and volynets are also playing in midland this week (brantmeier facing mcnally in the first round). \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* that concludes this year's list. hope you enjoyed it! i will try to be around next year to follow-up on the name mentioned above. with any luck, some of them will have gained wider attention by then, a well a the player in the 2020 list who are still on the rise. i should also say that there are currently 46 teenager in the top 500, and over this post and the last one i've covered not quite half of them, so there's an enormous depth of potential new talent out there. roll on 2022.",1635777184

1783,tennis,next gen of the week #9: coco gauff,"[previous post](?utm_medium=android_apputm_source=share) it's time for the last wta player of the year in this series. i wa planning one more originally, but this seems like a more fitting end, and i waited way too long between writing these. so without further ado, let's talk about the rising american, coco gauff. - age: 17 - ranking: 22 (race ranking of 17) - notable results: rg qf, 1000 sf, 2x 250 w - notable wins: osaka, sabalenka, bertens - strengths: shotmaking, athleticism, variety - weaknesses: forehand, second serve, gameplan often when talking about great players, there is a quality that can't quite be described - even if you talk about every aspect of someone like djokovic's game, you'll leave out the little miracle he produces. gauff can create those miraculous shots. when she's on the run, sliding into a backhand, she rip it crosscourt onto the line. there's no describing that exactly. it isn't her usual play, but those moment are something we see from a lot of great players. she come up with seemingly impossible shot under pressure, which is a difficult quality to teach. gauff's parent are former college athletes, so it's no surprise she's naturally athletic. her speed and strength, especially for someone so young, are amazing. she cover the court incredibly well, and ha the stability to make shot on the run without giving up power or accuracy. a she grows into her physical prime, this will only improve. the fact that she wa already capable of handling tour level speed and weight of shot at 15 is a testament to just how crazy her physical prowess is. if you've followed any of her double exploits, this next part won't come a a surprise. gauff ha great hand at the net, and us that to her advantage in singles. while her primary style involves trading from the baseline, she's unafraid to approach the net to finish off a point or just to mix up an opponent. with her level of power, this set her up for a lot of free point where she can simply go for a strong shot down the line and clean up the resulting putaway. while it isn't a primary focus of her game, it add another dimension that will be necessary a she progresses. despite her natural power, she hasn't quite channeled it into her forehand. her current technique involves a larger wind up that often result in her getting rushed on faster courts. even when she ha time, she still leaf the ball short in the court fairly often, giving opponent an opportunity to put her on defense. to utilize her full skillset, she need to be able to flatten out her forehand and use it a an offensive weapon, rather than letting it be passive. if she can fix this wing, it'll give her a much more solid game since opponent won't feel safe going to her forehand. the next issue seems to be a common one for younger player nowadays: she double fault a lot. while she's certainly improved this year, she still seems to lack confidence in her second serve. while it isn't a crazy amount like some people, (cough zverev cough), it certainly make her service game significantly more unstable. giving opponent a free point let's them know there's always a chance in any game - it confidence they don't have to earn that will always come back and bite you. luckily, it seems to be improving and i have high hope it'll mostly fade. her last problem is somewhat complicated. currently, gauff is in a weird stage where she ha a lot of option of how to grow. her athleticism make her a great defender, her power make her great at being an aggressive baseliner, and her variety can supplement anything. that put her in the awkward space where she doesn't really have a good gameplan. sometimes she's too passive and give her opponent too many opportunities. sometimes she's get too aggressive on the forehand and throw out errors. bringing it all together and figuring out what work best for her will be a challenge, especially a she continues to improve weaker aspect of her game. gauff's age and constant improvement make her winning a slam almost a when, not an if. but she still ha to actually do it. with no shortage of competition, nothing is a guarantee in the wta. whether she'll actually put the game together is an open question, but one i'm answering with yes. well, that's the last wta player of the year. to finish off this series for 2021, i'll be talking about jannik sinner next. after that, i'll see what writing project interest me. if anyone ha suggestions, feel free to tell me.",1635602581

1917,tennis,ranking roger federer's tennis season (2000-2021),"here is my ranking of roger's tennis season (in my opinion). i have given each season a rating from f to s, however keep in mind that this is roger federer we are talking about, so all of these rating are relative. **22. 2020** \- roger only played in one tournament this season, the australian open. despite this, he made the semi-final, bowing out to the eventual winner djokovic. he wa shut out for the rest of the season due to covid-19 concern and surgery. *rating:* **f** **21. 2021** \- roger's 2021 season consisted of 5 tournament - qatar, geneva, roland garros, halle and wimbledon. his best result definitely came at wimbledon, where he made the quarterfinal (becoming the oldest to do so at age 40). unfortunately, federer's season wa also cut short by surgery, resulting in him not competing after wimbledon. *rating:* **f** **20. 2000** \- this wa roger’s first impactful year on the tour. he competed in a total of 28 tournaments, however failed to win any and made 2 finals. despite, this his consistency gave him a **55%** win rate, and beat 3 top 10 players. he also finished 4th in the olympics, and made the 4th round of the french open. *rating:* **f** **19. 2016 -** the injury season. roger didn’t play for half of the season, due to a knee injury. despite this, he still managed to make the semifinal of ao and wimbledon, and made the final of brisbane international. overall, roger failed to pick up a title, and his win rate wa **75%**, meaning that this season wa one of his weaker ones. *rating:* **f** **18. 2001** \- roger won his first atp title (250 milan) this season, a well a making 2 more finals. he got his best result in a grand slam so far, making the qfs of the french open and wimbledon. his win rate for this season wa considerably higher, with a **70%** win rate. notably, he upset world number 6 pete sampras at wimbledon in the 4th round. *rating:* **f** **17. 2013** \- another injury season. while roger played throughout the whole season, a back injury meant that his form wa significantly hampered. his best result in the slam wa an ao semifinal, a he failed to get further than the qf in any other slam. throughout the year he won just one tournament (250) and made 2 final (1 m1000 and 1 500). his **73%** win rate wa not exceptional, but he did manage to beat 4 top 10 players. *rating:* **d** **16. 2002 -** federer’s first breakthrough. federer’s performance in the grand slam were actually worse than the previous year (2 4th round appearances). however, his master title at hamburg and his 3 total title (1 m1000, 1 500, 1 250) make up for this. at the miami open, he got his first win over a top ranked player (lleyton hewitt). he also accumulated 10 top 10 wins, and finished the year with a win rate of **71%**. *rating:* **d** **15. 2011** \- a great clay season. while many remember djokovic for the 2011 season, it would be a disservice to roger to suggest that his season wa unsuccessful. he made at least the qfs in every slam, an achievement he’s only done in 8 seasons. additionally, he made the fo final, beating peak djokovic in the semis. federer won 4 title this season (1 m1000, 1 500, 1 250, 1 wtf), including a surprise tour final win over jo-wilfried tsonga (denying favourite djokovic the title). his match win rate wa a very respectable **84%,** and he beat 10 top 10 player throughout the year. *rating:* **d** **14. 2019 -** a year of ‘almosts’. roger federer’s 2019 season could have been even greater, however despite some squandered match points, he still managed to compete well. in the slams, he got varying results, from 4r to a final appearance (at wimbledon). his semi-final appearance at the french open represented a very respectable run on clay. federer also won his 28th master title, at miami open. in total, federer picked up 4 title (1 m1000, 3 500s), and reached 2 more final (1 gs, 1 m1000). he ended the season with an **84%** win rate, which included 7 win over top 10 players. *rating:* **c** **13. 2014 -** comeback #1. after a poor 2013 season, an appointment of stefan edberg a co-coach with severen luthi seemed to be the catalyst to a fed resurgence. he made 3 slam semi final and 1 final (wimbledon), a considerably better performance than the previous year. he won 5 tournament (2 m1000s, 2 500s, 1 250), in addition to leading the swiss team to their first ever davis cup victory. in the master 1000s, he made a total of 5 finals, the highest in his career. he also made the final of the tour finals, however withdrew due to injury. he beat 1 top ranked player (novak djokovic) and 17 top 10 players, finishing with a very solid win rate of **86%** (the highest in the list so far). *rating:* **c** **12. 2015 -** the final season. federer had a respectable run in the slams, making 2 final (wimbledon and uso). unfortunately for him, this season wa dominated by djokovic, so federer would have to settle for runner up on many occasion. he did manage to win the cincinnati masters, and 6 total title (1 m1000, 3 500s, 2 250s). however, he also made 2 more master final and the final of the year end championship. he finished the season with a solid win rate of **85%**, which included 3 win of the man of the year, djokovic. he also took down 15 top 10 player throughout the season, including the like of nadal and murray. he finished the season world number 3, which make this season the best non-slam season of his life. *rating:* **c** **11. 2008 -** the loser of the greatest match of all time. roger federer’s 2008 season wa extremely consistent, however nadal’s level this year wa ridiculous. in the grand slams, federer completed a very impressive achievement of making the semi-final of every grand slam, and three finals. he ha only done this on 4 occasion in his entire career. in the final of wimbledon, federer and nadal had an absolute slugfest, where either player wa completely deserving of the win. so despite only winning one grand slam, federer wa inch away from winning a second. federer won 4 title in the season (1 gs, 3 250s) and made 8 finals. additionally, federer only ever lost to nadal in finals. federer picked up 7 win over top 10 players. he picked up a reasonable win rate of **81%**. *rating:* **c** **10. 2018** \- the 20th slam season. in the slams, federer started strongly with a win at ao. after intentionally missing roland garros, federer bowed out in the qf of wimbledon and the 4th round of uso. in master 1000s, federer failed to win any titles, however he made 2 final and 4 semifinal overall. he picked up 4 title (1 gs, 2 500s, 1 250). his year ended with an **83%** win rate, which involved beating 5 top 10 players. *rating:* **b** **9. 2003** \- the inaugural grand slam season. 2003 saw a solid improvement in federer’s game from 2002. he won his first grand slam (wimbledon, although you already knew that), and made 9 atp tour finals, winning 7 of them (1 gs, 2 500s, 3 250s, 1 yec). he also won the year end championship for the first time, beating world number 1 andy roddick en route to the final. federer claimed 9 win over top 10 players, ending the season with a win rate of **82%**. *rating:* **a** **8. 2010** \- federer’s 2010 season followed saw a dip in consistency in the middle of the year (summer hard court, clay court), however overall, he had an notable presence on the tour. he won the australian open, and made at least the qf of all of the other slams. he won 5 title (1 gs, 1 m100, 1 500, 1 250, 1 yec), interestingly at each level of the tour. this included a year end championship title which involved beating world number 1 rafa nadal. federer picked up 16 win over top 10 players, an ended the year with a decent win rate of **83%.** *rating:* **b** **7. 2012 -** a surge season. roger’s performance in the slam wa the strongest in the list so far, with a win in wimbledon, 3 sf appearance and 4 quarterfinal appearances. he also played in 10 finals, winning 6 of them (1 gs, 3 m1000s, 2 500s). he finished the year with a win rate of **86%**, which involved beating 16 top 10 players, including world number 1 djokovic. *rating:* **a** **6. 2017** \- the biggest comeback of his career. federer’s 2017 season wa incredible, a it marked a total resurgence after the injury plagued 2016 season. he only competed in 3 slam (skipped rg), winning 2 of them (ao, wim) and making a 3rd qf. he won 7 title (2 gs, 3 m1000s, 2 500s), and competed in 8 final (losing in the canadian open to zverev). he finished the season with an incredible win rate of **92%**, the 4th highest in his career. federer took down 14 top 10 players, including world number 1 rafael nadal. *rating:* **a** **5. 2009 -** the channel slam. one of federer’s greatest achievement wa finally reached this year, a he won the french open to complete the career grand slam (one of each grand slam titles). after losing to nadal in 3 consecutive roland garros final leading up to this, it must have been a huge relief for federer to hear that robin soderling upset nadal in the 2nd round. federer had an unbelievable run in the slam this season, making all 4 final (only one of 5 men to do this in the open era), and winning 2 of them (rg, wim). he won 4 title (2 gs, 2 m1000s), and made 3 more finals. federer accumulated a reasonable win rate of **84%**, but he managed to take down 15 top 10 players, including world number 1 rafael nadal (to finish year end number 1 for the fifth time in his career). *rating:* **a** **4. 2005 -** the beast season. federer had an exceptional 2005 season, making all 4 grand slam semifinals, and going on to win 2 of them (wim, uso). additionally, federer won a whopping 4 master 1000 titles, and an incredible **11 titles** overall (2 gs, 4 m1000s, 2 500s, 3 250s). he finished the season with a mouthwatering **95%** win rate, the joint highest of his career (one of the highest out of any player season ever). federer took down 15 top 10 players, and beat world number 2 lleyton hewitt twice, finishing world number 1. *rating:* **s** **3. 2007 -** the hardcourt season. roger’s performance in the slam this season were the joint-greatest in his career. he won 3 slams, and made the final of roland garros, losing to nadal. he won the year end championship for the 4th time, a well a 2 master (making a total of 5 master finals). overall, his title count wa **8** (3 gs, 1 yec, 2 m1000s, 1 500, 1 250). federer had a win rate of **88%,** but 4 of his 9 loss that season came in finals. roger beat **17** top 10 players, including world number 2 rafa nadal 3 times. *rating:* **s** **2. 2004** \- the season that introduced the world to roger federer. this wa the first of federer's three slam season (ao, wim, uso), with his only defeat coming at the 3rd round of the french open. federer also won 3 masters, and the year end championship, to take his total title tally to **11!** (3 gs, 1 yec, 3 m1000s, 1 500, 3 250s). federer put together a ridiculous win rate of **93%**, have lost just 6 match in the entire year. he finished comfortably a world number 1, having defeated **18** top 10 players, including world number 2 andy roddick 3 times. *rating:* **s** **1.** **2006** \- the greatest season of all time (in my opinion). roger's 2006 tennis season wa nearly perfect. in the grand slams, he won 3 and made the final of the french open for the first time, losing to nadal in 4 sets. federer won 4 master titles, making another 2 finals, and brought home the year end championship. his total title count for this season wa a tremendous **12** titles, with a ludicrous **16** finals! of course, the statistic that stand far and above the rest is roger's insane win-loss ratio: **92-5 (95% win rate)**. of these 5 losses, 4 came at the hand of nadal (3 of those being in clay finals). the only tournament that roger failed to make the final of wa the cincinnati masters, where he lost to an inspired andy murray in two close sets. there is really no way i can truly wrap my head around this season, federer wa easily the best grass and hard court player, and dominated the clay courts, losing only to the greatest clay courter ever. *rating:* **s**",1635409846

2238,tennis,appreciation for michael chang,"when i wa a kid, i had the opportunity to be a ball boy for a men’s challenger tournament. i didn’t really appreciate tennis history, and all i really knew wa sampras vs. agassi at the time. that year the challenger tournament hosted andy roddick, james blake, vince spadea, and michael chang. chang nearing the end of his career. i didn’t really know who michael chang wa at the time, but i noticed that his demeanor wa very different from the other tennis players. for example, when he asked me for a towel on court, he didn’t just point at it or make a face-wiping motion. he looked at me and said, “would you mind handing me that towel, please?” everything wa please and thank you, whether it wa the ball kid or his opponent. this wa in hot and humid weather too. very different from some of the other player who seemed to have no regard for other people on the court. or even some who would yell at the staff when something wasn’t perfect (or just for the hell of it). michael chang wa incredibly gracious to everyone. those little interaction made a very big impression on me a a kid. i know that there are other player who pleasant people, but those few interaction with michael chang were so staggeringly different than the other player with who i came into contact that week. now that i’m older, i can appreciate michael chang’s place in tennis history. there wasn’t any youtube back then, so i’m having fun watching his matchplay in his prime. michael chang is such an underappreciated professional american tennis player. world #2, the youngest man to ever win a grand slam (being the first american in a long time to win), 34 professional titles, and one of the youngest men's player to crack the atp top 10. although he “only” had one grand slam title under his belt, he is so rarely mentioned when talking about great american men’s tennis players. maybe he isn't a explosive a roddick, a iconic a james blake, and doesn't have a many title a mcenroe, but he deserves some recognition! just wanted to post that memory of him. i hope i can meet him again one day to thank him for what he ha done for tennis!",1634919472

2255,tennis,opinion regarding djokovic' many antiscience view,"many people think djokovic is a terrible and an extremely selfish person for being antivax. i disagree for the following reasons. andre agassi said djokovic doesn't believe in strength training and eating the right amount of protein after he decided to stop working with him. these two are the most important factor according to scientific research for improving athletic performance and even for general health in all humans. also he decided to not have the elbow surgery for so long which actually affected him. it's clear that he just doesn't trust science and medicine a a whole even when it benefit him.from this, i don't see how him being antivax mean he is a selfish person. vaccination is a net benefit for almost all individual and it is not even a irritating a wearing a mask everyday. you just get jabbed once or twice. he is not vaccinated not because he is selfish rather he doesn't understand science. i and most of u are taught science in school and i saw how science explained and predicted most thing in the world and i gradually developed a trust in the scientific process. he is someone who didn't have proper education and he wa mostly taught by his coach. he mentioned this in his autobiography. i don't see how it is possible for me and you to judge him on this. i have no idea how i would have turned out if i wa raised in his circumstances.",1634898884

2349,tennis,idea for a cli tennis simulation game?,"ok, this isn't really serious so, i'm kind of obsessed with the tennis scoring system, and i'm also learning the c language, so recently i made a simple program that simulates a tennis match (just each player ha 50% chance to win each point), just for fun. i remember we played a similar thing with my dad when i wa like 5 year old, with flipping a coin. that's what inspired me. i really want to play tennis now, because the scoring system is very exciting, but 1. i can't play it irl now 2. my pc isn't very powerful to run any existing game like ao tennis etc, and i couldn't manage to run them on linux anyway. and i didn't like them anyway when i got to play them. so now i started learning c++, and now i kinda want to make something more complex, i.e. 1. make it so you can actually somehow control the game, e.g. choose how to hit, topspin or slice, etc. 2. make it so when you serve, you actually have an advantage 3. implement some kind of a momentum thing, e.g. you have better chance of winning if you have won several point in a row or something like this, idk yet 4. and other thing that may make it more exciting i don't yet know enough to make a game with graphics, so it's a console line game obviously ok, so i just wanted to ask if you can suggest any ideas? and maybe idea how to write the function and structure everything? and i still idk how to actually write it, so far i think a ""player"" class is definitely necessary, it'll be something like class player { private: char* name = nullptr; int point = 0; int game = 0; int set = 0; int ace = 0; int unforced_errors = 0; etc. public: int serve(player opp); etc. }; idk if i need something like a ""game""/""set""/""match"" class, or maybe something like a friend function of class player",1634756211

2354,tennis,some young player you should know about 2020 -- where are they now? part iii: wta,"i found [this post from the archives]() on a random search a couple of week back. that post, presenting several promising youngster to look out for, wa written on october 12th 2020. the original poster ha since deleted their account, but i thought it would be fun to do a one-year follow-up anyway. i split this post up into several parts. part i, on atp player from the list above, is [here](). in this third part, i'm looking at the wta player that were highlighted a name to watch last year. a before, i'll be covering all name from the original list, in the order they were presented. each player also ha tag (country; age in format years.months; world ranking on the 12th october 2020 list; current ranking at time of posting). if player are also active juniors, then their current junior ranking will be included a well (or instead, if they only play on the junior circuit), with a prefix j. hence, for example: **clara burel** (france; 20.7; 240; 75) make her 20 year and 7 month old, ranked 240 on october 12th 2020, and is 75th on the most recent list (18th october). **2020 (and earlier) breakthroughs** **clara burel** (france; 20.7; 240; 75): at the time of the post above, burel had broken into the top 250 for the first time following a run to the third round at roland garros. since then she's continued to progress, with three itf titles, the most recent of which wa earlier this month in cherbourg, and a wta250 final at lausanne, seeing her to her career-high ranking of 75th. still, we are perhaps waiting for that big tour-level title win that will propel her to the status of some of her younger fellow stars. **cori ""coco"" gauff** (usa; 17.7; 55; 23): even now i think it's easy to overlook gauff or forget how young she still is, but she's continuing to move up the rankings, debuting in the top 20 for the first time recently on the back of consistent deep run in tournament in the first half of this season, including her second wta title and debut grand slam qf appearance. ha also the potential for a promising double career, making the u open final with caty mcnally, and reaching the indian well double qf with leylah fernandez. and on top of that she's *still* the youngest of the established player on this list! i'm sure there's more to come yet. **leylah fernandez** (canada; 19.1; 89; 27): it wa her run to the third round at rg2020 that got fernandez mentioned in last year's post. 2021 saw her win her first wta title, at monterrey. after that, she struggled a bit for consistency, winning nine match but losing 11. and then the u open happened. that run of victory over osaka, kerber, svitolina and sabalenka will live long in the memory. making them all dramatic three-setters too wa a lovely touch! what's been perhaps even more impressive is how she sustained that form into indian wells, beating another top player in pavlyuchenkova and only narrowly losing to shelby rogers. can't wait to see what is next for her, not least because her brand of tennis is seriously exciting to watch. never let up in intensity or willpower, and a great match-player. the only thing that make me wonder how far she can go right now is that her serve is a little vulnerable, meaning that she isn't often winning match quickly -- that's something she might try to work on. if she can fix that she'll go far. **iga świątek** (poland; 20.5; 17; 11): imagine winning your debut title at roland garros, picking up two more title the following season, making the fourth round or better at every slam (being the only woman this season to do so), briefly breaking into the top 5, and still being basically overshadowed by everybody around you of a similar age. but swiatek's season following her remarkable rg2020 victory ha been very impressive, and i don't doubt for a second that she'll stay at the top of the game for a long time yet. perhaps even the relative lack of attention will help her focus on just playing well and continuing to improve. another player whose style of play i've come to enjoy. **young player to watch** **wang xiyu** (china; 20.7; 120; 140): since her semi-final run at acapulco, sadly 2018 u open junior champion wang hasn't been on a great run of form this year, with a run of seven straight loss at the start of the year. also hasn't played a tour-level match since july, in part because of a focus on the china national games. picked up a wta125 double title recently, and made her return to single last week in a w25 event, reaching the final, so perhaps she'll be soon back on track. **elisabetta cocciaretto** (italy; 20.9; 131; 137): another player who hasn't yet broken through, although this time primarily due to a knee injury, a she hasn't played since july. apparently, she's [recently had surgery and is still in rehab](). had a nice run to the semi-finals at guadalajara in march, which helped her reach 108 in the rankings, but we'll have to wait until next season to see if she can recover and live up to last year's potential. **wang xinyu** (china; 20.1; 150; 114): last year, wang xiyu's slightly younger near-namesake wa only mentioned in passing, but i thought i'd expand on her a bit. xinyu's junior career wa le prolific than some, reaching a couple of junior slam semi but losing to swiatek and burel. her last two junior match were a double-bagel victory over leylah fernandez, and a narrow defeat to clara tauson, so she wa competitive with many of the star of this generation. started playing adult tournament in 2016, winning her first itf title in 2018 and three on the bounce in 2019, bringing her into the top 150 this time last year. 2021 started slowly, but xinyu's retained and slightly improved her ranking, with season-best result being the semi at prague in july, and the final at the columbus w125 in september. played this week in tenerife and had a good run, but sadly had to pull out of her match against cornet due to an injury. **clara tauson** (denmark; 18.10; 155; 48): 2021 ha definitely been tauson's breakthrough season. two wta250 titles, a victory over a certain emma raducanu to win the chicago wta125, and a climb up to just inside the top 50. in any normal season she'd probably be a shoo-in for the most improved player of the year award, although i suspect that'll go to krejcikova. i should also add that her manner of victory over ostapenko at luxembourg, to win her second tour title, wa seriously impressive. only six unforced error through the entire match, to 31 winners! still plenty she can add to her game, but this wa a great call by our anonymous poster, and i'm sure we've yet to see even close to tauson's full potential. also featuring in tenerife this week. **maria camila osorio serrano** (colombia; 19.10; 205, 63): the sixth highest-ranked under-20 player on the wta, osorio serrano ha definitely justified her place in this list too. her debut title came on home soil, which must have been a wonderful moment for her, and since then she's reached a couple of semi-finals, a well a the third round at wimbledon, taking her up to 63rd for a climb of almost 150 ranking places. since wimbledon, osorio serrano ha had a bit of a barren run, with one win from seven matches, but that came to an end with her career-best win over svitolina at tenerife this week. **alexandra eala** (philippines; 16.5; n/a; 525; j2; j4): a with the rest of the player in the wta list, she's still too young to judge, but the last year ha nevertheless been a fine one for eala. she's mixing junior tournament with low-tier itf tournaments, winning one this year, and ha even played one wta250 main draw, earning her debut victory at that level. a a result, she's climbed all the way up to just outside the top 500. another fine shout, then, and keep an eye on her next season! **victoria jimenez kasintseva** (andorra; 16.2; n/a; 390; j1; j1): the andorran youngster ha also tried her luck at itf tournaments, with her best result a run to the final at san bartolome only a couple of month back. perhaps somewhat tired from her efforts, she got thrashed by arantxa rus, but must nevertheless have been thrilled to win seven straight match and charge up the rankings. she recently broke the top 400, too, and is among the top teenager on tour right now. another to keep an eye on for the next couple of season a she continues to play both juinors and itf events. **brenda fruhvirtova** (czechia, 14; j309\*; j10): when she wa included last year, she had just won a junior title (and helped the czech to the world junior tennis final title in 2019). since then, she's added five more junior title to her collection, progressing up the junior ladder to become already among the top 10 juniors. there are still, i think, a couple of year before we'll see her competing at senior events, but there's no doubting that brenda is among the top junior talent already. also worth noting that she's on a 15-match winning streak, and ha won 26 of her last 28 matches. (\*j309 is her end of 2020 ranking.) **honourable mentions** **robin montgomery** (usa; 17.1; 560: 372; j7\*; j2): follows up her honourable mention last year with a victory at the u open girls' single this year, making her the second-ranked junior behind kasintseva (whom she beat on the way to that u open title). hasn't had a much success on the senior circuit yet, but notable result include a victory over osorio serrano earlier this year, and with a ranking inside the top 400 ha continued to move steadily up. (\*j7 is her end of 2020 ranking.) **daria snigur** (ukraine; 19.7; 224; 184): snigur made the honourable mention presumably off the back of three itf title and the 2019 wimbledon girls' single title. she's added one more itf title in 2021, and ha made it to the top 200 on the back of another final, but ha not perhaps shone to the same level a many others on this list. still plenty of time of course, and is at least moving in the right direction! **daria lopatetska** (ukraine; 18.6; 356; 482): lopatetska burst onto the scene three year ago, winning her first 18 adult-level matches, and five of her first ten itf tournaments, a a result zooming up the ranking to a peak of 216, while still barely 16. then she suffered a knee injury in 2019, and it seems that she hasn't fully recovered from it to this day. after another extended break, from july this year, on the back of five straight losses, she returned to the court earlier this month and is back to winning match again. a long road back, but if she's back to fitness maybe the result will come again to match her clear talent. **linda fruhvirtova** (czechia; 16.5; 787; 335; j18\*; j8): brenda's older sister is no le promising, with two itf title and two further final already, and a good result at charleston in april 2021 -- admittedly, in part because cornet retired, but only when linda had taken her to a third set. already being inside the top 350 make her the third-best under-18 player in the wta rankings, ahead of several others on the list above. still mixing junior and adult events, both sister have great potential, and it won't be a surprise to see them both break through within the next few years. (\*j18 is her end of 2020 ranking.) \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* last, but not least, eagle-eyed reader will have noticed that i skipped one name from the original list... **emma raducanu** (uk; 18.11; 344; 24): when our esteemed u/\[deleted\] included raducanu in this list, she wa described a promising youngster whose result were nevertheless ""pedestrian"", and hadn't yet played a main tour match. a year later, she's a history-making u open champion. i'm still not sure how that happened. not gonna lie, raducanu's the reason i found this list... what a prediction u/\[deleted\] made! i don't think they had *this* set of result in mind though! that she's barely even started is the most impressive, and the scariest, aspect of this incredible breakthrough. the next stage of emma's career is perhaps going to be the most important, a she's basically skipped all of the usual grind through lower-tier tournament that many of the others above have gone through, and is currently looking for a coach, and for that matter her first tour win outside slams. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* seven clear success (burel, gauff, fernandez, swiatek, tauson, osorio serrano, raducanu); five moving in the right direction without breaking through yet (eala, kasintseva, brenda fruhvirtova, montgomery, linda fruhvirtova); and five who've probably been stalled in part due to injury or other factor (wang xiyu, cocciaretto, wang xinyu, snigur, lopatetska). whoever u/\[deleted\] was, they're a genius. next time: new name to add to the wta list.",1634752537

2378,tennis,i think novak will be forced to retire from tennis,"now the australian open ha effectively banned novak from playing there unless he can prove he’s been double vaccinated i only see this a an opportunity for every tournament on the entire atp and wta tour to follow suit. it would be bizarre for only the ao to enforce these draconian rule and i see the other 3 major announcing the same rule and that player will have to be double jabbed to p,ay there or they won’t be allowed, simple. so novak ha 2 options, get vaccinated and play where he wants, or be refused entry to literally all the tournament that mean something to him such a the slam and opt not to play unless the rule are changed again or he announces his retirement. i think if he were still on 17 slam today he wouldn’t be playing because the travelling and covid rule would be too much for him, he only played last year because the “grand slam” wa on the line. the problem lie with where he will potentially get #21……if it ever happens. if novak doesn’t get vaxxed , it won’t be the ao",1634727023

however, user upvote/comment pattern during the uso suggested otherwise. **improvements required:** \- increasing availability of wta discussion and creating an environment where people can discus such topic without negative comment or sexist remarks. \- discussion of possible future wta ama’s with official representative if opportunity present itself. **memes** **current state:** the meme community in the subreddit ha been healthy and abundant with multiple meme posting daily. concern have been raised towards the frequency of meme posting and that of the overall quality of such posts. meme have also been used a a method of baiting user into argument in the same manner a some big 3 thread have. **improvements required:** many option of how to regulate meme have been considered with many pro and con to each solution. **no one choice is set in stone a of the date of this post:** \- meme only allowed on certain day of the week or \- low effort meme rule meme pose a difficult situation for u a they play an important role in allowing u to gauge community thought a well a popular topics. **bad faith** **current state:** many discussion in the big 3 flair posse a degree of bad faith in where user engage in debate with no intention to debate fairly or accept the other side's points. such offence include: \- discounting another player achievement within an argument to benefit your own argument \- engaging discussion under false pretense \- concern trolling ""sealioning"" other user **improvements required:** stricter enforcement of rule on offending post and education of what defines “bad faith” within rule to prevent unaware rule breaking in the community. heightened alertness during big 3 matches, active restriction of debate post during occasion of either wta or big 3 contention. **rules** **current state:** we felt that many time when we enforced the rule that some user felt unclear to how such rule affected their post/comments. rule such a #1 (play nice) #5 (low effort rule) lack clarification for removals; sometimes a rule wasn’t in place for certain outlier situations. **improvements require:** revision and expansion of rule to include more in depth explanation for user and give wider moderator understanding of rule breaking behaviour. coming soon. additional reasoning for post removal reply to increase clarity. **reporting** **current state:** during the uso, we had a user report backlog going back to last year. many case of rule breaking behaviour had been reported and had gone unreviewed by the mod team due to lack of moderator available. during the uso, the mod team ha successfully cleared the backlog to allow accurate monitoring of report from user with relative success during the uso. while user report did increase during the uso, many account of rule breaking behaviour had gone unreported, which left the detection of such posts/comments down to moderators, unfortunately increasing the amount of time offensive comment remain up. **improvements required:** \- continued encouragement of reporting to user in daily match thread and post match posts, using stickies and face of sub moderators. \- active transparency towards user to demonstrate the process and outcome for when comments/posts are reported, building confidence within the community. **mod-user relationship** **current state:** before the uso, many of the mod team were unable to actively daily moderate the subreddit due to irl obligations. a such, many user had complained of a lack of moderation within the subreddit a a cause of increased rule breaking and off topic discussion, leading to low morale between both parties. with the introduction of the new mod team members, an active drive to increase visibility ha been established a a method of building support from concerned user and of deterring rule breaking through increased active presence. while some user have objected to such sticky posts, we feel this course of action is still the most viable towards achieving our set goal for the meanwhile. **improvements required:** \- continued presence in popular threads. \- increased approachable behaviour to user both in modmail and comment section for concern raised on all matters. \- introduction of a new universal mod ""u/nextgenbot"" for handling of post and scheduling stickies, etc. **misinformation** **current state:** we find that occasionally content is shared within the subreddit that is worded to start drama or is just plain false, many of these offender are online article or journalist abusing the trust user put in their reporting. **improvements required:** the banning of misinformation by known web page journalist (ex. luigi gatto) on the subreddit, which will be detailed in the rule update.",1634654268

2845,tennis,year-end #1 situation after medvedev lost in the round of 16 of indian wells.,"medvedev is currently 1900 point behind djokovic in the live race to turin which is deciding ye #1 this year. with his loss to dimitrov, it ha become much harder for medvedev to catch up to djokovic and get ye #1. one hypothetical scenario in which medvedev would overtake djokovic and get ye #1 would be if djokovic didn't play for the rest of the year and medvedev won paris master and wa the runner-up in tour final after winning 3 round-robin match along the way. but if djokovic only play tour final and win just 1 round-robin match, medvedev would need to win paris master and tour final with 3 round-robin win along the way. technically speaking, there is a maximum of 3250 point on offer for the rest of 2021 after indian well (antwerp 250, vienna 500, paris masters, stockholm 250, and tour finals), so medvedev could make the job easier by taking wildcards into the 250s and/or 500s, but i doubt he will do that. djokovic could clinch the ye #1 if he win paris master and medvedev doesn't make it to the finals. but djokovic would only have to do that much if medvedev win a 250 and a 500 between now and paris masters. if medvedev doe not play between now and paris masters, djokovic could clinch ye #1 by winning paris master (regardless of medvedev's result). so, it seems pretty likely that djokovic will be ye #1.",1634167600

2905,tennis,"a a tennis player, have you ever had a moment where your luck began to shift?","okay so long story short growing up i never wa drawn to competitive activity , and i don’t have too much experience with it. like for example i would primarily play single player videogames and what not and not be too heavily invested into a single thing where i wa dedicated in reaching top of the ranks, school included. of course i have the reputation of picking thing up easily and learning fast and i kind of sit with that reputation - being able to do thing with le effort than other people - and never really moving past that stage. i know some people seem just naturally good and more at home in the competitive mindset in which case cross over into any competitive related field. it feel like they just have that stroke of luck which other people don’t . that thing are stressful but there’s a sense of control in the situation and that the outcome could very much be swayed to their favor. it seems this is a gift which some people have. of course practice and experience count the most but i feel like it only go so far. and some people just have this stroke of competitive spirit which is an “i’m going to win” attitude which probably is displayed early a a kid. i’m someone who often hears the term talented, or genius thrown at me a lot but when it come to anything that is competitive nature i’ve lost far more than i’ve won. i’m wondering for some, wa there ever a lightbulb moment in your life where at one point you felt in a perpetual state of losing until some point there wa a spiritual shift in you where you felt like you had luck on your side ? or would you say it is either a natural gift or an extremely slow gradual process that the change simply crept up on you?",1634105855

2963,tennis,andy murray is going to domesticate alexander zverev,"alexander zverev sure is ready to punch his ticket to the indian well quarter final later today. many have tipped it to be a physical battle and his training regime appears to have been adapted accordingly, given the thunderous activity sounding from his hotel room. sparring partner nikoloz basilashvili wa only scheduled to stay an hour but it seems both have lost track of time – and boundaries, a a mistimed diving slam almost sends the georgian through the ceiling below. good thing the other guest were evacuated hour ago. ala for andy murray in the next-door room, he missed the evacuations, having been sat on the can all morning playing metal gear solid. it’s only when a particularly intense somersault kick sends some plaster crumbling down onto his mobile screen that he finally remove his headphones. in his hurry to escape the vicinity, he accidentally flush his wedding ring down the toilet, which he is now desperately trying to retrieve before the roof cave in. he hasn’t felt this much danger since he and kim sat down to watch lorenzo sonego’s home birthing tutorial. meanwhile, the players’ downtime tour of california state didn't go much better. thing didn’t get off to a great start when emma raducanu fired the tour guide after five minutes, while lorenzo musetti suffered a breakdown after seeing an instagram update from his ex-girlfriend. naomi osaka had to be ejected after calling in the paparazzo five time along route 66, and the outrage wa palpable upon finding former delray beach finalist donald young’s star had been stolen from the hollywood walk of fame. carlos alcaraz got lost on the way to san francisco, while boris becker sadly got left behind in vegas, somewhere between the strip and the wedding chapel. becker will at least have company in the casino tonight - in the form of dominic thiem, who ha been hitting the table hard amidst the pain of being unable to defend his indian well title this year. from poker to blackjack, wheelbarrow racing to projected sale of radek stepanek’s 2022 calendar – there's nothing he won’t place a bet on. wrist injury are never easy, and kevin anderson can certainly empathise – he required reconstructive surgery on his after all the autograph he had to sign following sunday’s win over sonego. rumour ha it he will be playing left-handed against monfils later tonight. which is probably still one hand more than zverev will be able to play with, if his sparring session doesn't end soon.",1634055701

it ha to be said, though, that on the men's side breakthrough tend to come later, so it's likely to be some year before many of these player come to wider notice assuming they do go on to break through. this also explains why a lot of the atp player on the list from last year are still (alcaraz aside) competing mainly at a lower level. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* **atp** **juan manuel cerundolo** (argentina; 19.11; 103): perhaps including somebody that is about to break into the top 100 is not exactly a hot take, but cerundolo make this list anyway because he arguably could have made it onto last year's list. at the time (october 2020) he wa ranked just inside the top 350, and 2021 ha been a pretty decent year. one atp 250 title on debut, along with three challenger titles, ha propelled cerundolo around 250 place in the rankings. this isn't the first time cerundolo ha been noticed by r/tennis: see [this post]( for a recent and more detailed evaluation, which also provides reason why we maybe should not expect him to rise to the very top. also, all the title mentioned above have come on clay. still, being sixth on the tour among under-21 player is no joke. currently playing in the santiago challenger, needing two more match win to break the top 100. **luca nardi** (italy; 18.2; 442): one of several youngster who presumably made a decision to leave most junior competition behind comparatively early. whilst still 16 he picked up a first itf title, and ha won two more this year, bringing him well into the top 450 (from 800th seven month ago). started to pick up match win at challenger events, including his biggest yet against yuichi sugita, ranked at the the time just outside the top 100. most of his success so far ha come on clay; it will be interesting to see if he's capable of playing well on other surfaces. expect to see him inside the top 300 at least before too long. **arthur fils:** (france; 17.4; 672; j6): one of only two under-18 player in the men's top 1000, and the highest-rated, the losing finalist in the 2021 boys' french open ha recently started playing adult matches, with two itf men's semi-finals and one final to his credit so far. despite losing to luca van assche (who appears next in this list), he's had a little more success transition to the adult tour. breaking through at any level on the men's tour a a 17-year-old is rare, and i wouldn't be surprised if we hear more from at least one of fils and van assche. i just don't know *which* yet. **luca van assche** (france; 17.5; 682; j4): the second of three under-18 player in the top 1000, and the recent boys' single french open champion. hasn't had a much success on the adult circuit a his fellow frenchman arthur fils (whom he beat in the final), but there aren't many other youngster who have come close to breaking through yet. last week he had a nice run at an itf tournament, making the semi-finals in nevers and lifting him to his highest-ever live ranking. **shang juncheng** (china; 16.8; 1000; j1): the current junior #1, shang is also still only 16 and much younger than most of the boy rated below him. that is already a promising sign. no junior slam title yet, although his ranking is justified by his remarkable consistency: qf at the french, sf at wimbledon, and the final at the recent u open, along with three high-level junior title this year. what's more, he recently played in, and won, an itf men's title in fayetteville (in his first-ever main draw itf appearance!), while in his first senior-level match he took liam broady, ranked 158th at the time, to three set at the miami qualifiers. it may well be a while before we see if this potential lead anywhere, but boy is there plenty of potential here! very briefly appeared in the live top 1000 last week, and ha a chance to make it official this week. honourable mentions: **daniel rincon** (spain; 18.9; 983; j2): 2021 boys' single u champion who ha only recently started playing itf-level tournaments. finally break the live top 1000 for the first time this week, but a comparatively late breakthrough. **federico cina** (italy; 14; j555): a 14-year-old appearing in the junior top 1000 is something of a feat itself (there are only four currently). cina recently won his first junior title and got to the final of a second. also the [losing finalist in the prestigious petits a 2021](). the victor of that match, **maxim mrva**, may also be worth mentioning, but hasn't yet made the transition to the itf junior tour. anything bigger is a long way off, but an impressive start. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* that concludes this list. ha to be said, it's been hard to find new name to add, partly because the atp list from last year wa so comprehensive, and also because it typically take longer for men's player to break through to the top. but hopefully some of the player above will turn out just a well, given a couple more year or so. next time: where are they now? wta player from last year's list.",1634024527

3020,tennis,"abuse, lies, plagiarism: it show the ugly side of tennis (simon graf article about ben rothenburg translated from german to english)","his research into alleged attack by alexander zverev against an ex-girlfriend triggered an investigation. what make the world's most powerful tennis journalist tick? alexander zverev is playing an excellent season, became olympic champion in tokyo and is gradually working to meet the high expectation he ha aroused with his talent. but a dark cloud hovers over the german: the abuse allegation of his ex-girlfriend olga sharipova, with whom he wa together from september 2018 to october 2019. the 24-year-old russian claim she wa repeatedly beaten by him. because of the physical and psychological violence against her, she even tried twice to kill herself by injecting an overdose of insulin. u reporter ben rothenberg followed up on her allegations, which first circulated in russia, and made them public for the first time le than a year ago and stuck to the story. zverev ha repeatedly denied the allegation and taken legal action. the case ha been simmering in the background for a long time and divide the tennis scene. the laver cup, the event organized by federer manager tony godsick, blocked anyone on twitter who posted anything about it, a zverev wa one of the most important participants. well-known tv commentator mary carillo even withdrew from the event because she did not want to be silenced. now the atp, the association of professional male player and organizer of the tour, ha taken action and ha launched an investigation. atp managing director massimo calvelli said: “the allegation against zverev are serious. we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of them. we hope that our investigation will allow u to establish the fact and take the appropriate action. "" he welcome this step, said zverev in indian wells. he would have wished for it a year ago because he suffered from the allegations. for rothenberg it is a satisfaction that the atp is now active. if the freelance tennis reporter, who also writes for the ""new york times"", hadn't worked through this relationship drama in a journalistic way, this would hardly have happened. he came across the affair on social media: ""i saw an instagram post from sharypova in russian and wanted to find out what wa behind it,"" he said in an interview during the u open. his story are a fluid a his text - it just gush out of him. “then i found out that she wa in new jersey, so very close. i met her and when i listened to it i thought it wa a story worth writing down.” he published the first part (“olya’s story”) in november 2020 in “racquet magazine”, a magazine that appears four time a year with carefully written background story about the world of tennis. the second (“every day, i wa crying”) in late august in the online magazine “slate”, which belongs to the “washington post”. rothenberg had carried the follow-up story around with him for eight months, had it checked by fact checker and lawyers, before he published it four day before the start of the u open. that rothenberg researched sharipova's accusation in detail and wrote them down is typical of him. the 34-year-old from washington is known for digging up the awkward story many of which keep hand off. in doing so, he polarizes the scene. some find that he is a polluter who make a name for himself at the expense of others and know no consideration for losses. others admire his courage and welcome the fact that he want to shed light on the ugly side of the glamorous world of tennis. he's a mix of tennis nerd and journalistic pit bull. a a child he wa a big tennis fan, say rothenberg. his father took him to the final weekend of the u open several time a a teenager, around 2000, 01, 02. ""at that time the williams sister dominated, i wa a big fan of them,"" he says. at some point he began to debate tennis in fan forums, then he started his own blog (“the daily forehand”). this is how he got his first accreditation for tournaments, and the new york time soon hired him a a freelancer. whether you like him or not, rothenberg ha already triggered a lot in the scene for his comparatively young age. the first story of his that made wave wa the one in july 2014 about the plagiarism of the renowned and award-winning time journalist neil harman. these appeared in the official wimbledon yearbook, which harman had hastily written since 2004 following the championships. harman wa the face of the english tennis journalists. jovial, always in a good mood, welcome everywhere. he played golf with rafael nadal, drank coffee with stan wawrinka, joked with roger federer. but then he became arrogant. for several volume of the wimbledon yearbook, he copied entire section from other newspaper - without citing the source. from the guardian, the new york times, the sport illustrated, the telegraph, the independent. what intellectual property theft is. this wa also heard by the wimbledon officials, which is why they informed harman in spring 2014 that he would no longer write the yearbook in future. that would probably have settled the matter if rothenberg had not meticulously proven all plagiarism of the 2011, 12 and 13 yearbook on ""slate"" (""unforced errors"", ""more unforced errors""). the sum is astounding, a is the audacity with which harman copied. he even made mistakes. two day after rothenberg's first article, the tennis reporter wa released from the time and subsequently dismissed. he ha not had access to the all england club since then. doesn't that arouse sympathy with rothenberg, who brought down harman with his stubbornness? “this story wasn't easy for me because we knew each other from the press room,” say the american, who ha been a journalist at grand slam tournament since 2012. «we were on friendly terms. i had nothing against neil personally. but the story had to be told. there were many british reporter just waiting for someone to do it. "" harman ha not found a job in journalism since then and wrote some sport books. the consistency with which rothenberg run through his story once he ha decided on them show his understanding of journalism. he doesn't just want to write beautiful stories, he want to look behind the scene and trigger something. he says: “in this sport, so many thing happen behind closed door and in area that we don't know about. on all level of human existence. we only understand this world superficially.” in august 2018, for example, rothenberg portrayed the estonian rainer piirimets (“losers’ lunch ”), who moved at the lower end of the tennis ecosystem - and in half-legality. piirimets worked a a courtsider, a an assistant to professional bettors. his job wa to follow the game on site and to provide his client with information about the score faster than the live score or to report if a player had health problems. a lot of money can be made with online betting with this knowledge advantage. courtsider is a demanding job. you have to be wide awake, recognize early on when a ball is going out of bound (before it hit the ground), and watch the player closely. then there is the constant fear of getting caught. because the tournament don't want courtsiders in their stadiums. piirimets wa handcuffed at the 2017 u open and had to spend such story are what fascinate rothenberg. or that of darko, who posed on social medium a a 20-year-old exceptional talent from north macedonia who had just woken up from a coma and now wanted to conquer the atp tour. instead, the story conquered the online universe, darko's tweet in which he condemned homophobia or racism were shared thousand of times, even serena williams, martina navratilova and the bbc fell for him. that show how easy it is to spread fake news. and what influence social medium have. with almost 100,000 follower on twitter, rothenberg ha become a power factor in tennis itself. the player know that too. novak djokovic, who felt attacked by him, involved him in a nine-minute verbal exchange of blow during a press conference in rome in may 2019. ""i'm not looking for such confrontations,"" say rothenberg. “but i'm not afraid of them either. and i wa very curious what novak had to say to me.” the extroverted australian nick kyrgios repeatedly reported against rothenberg on social medium - until he talked to him for 50 minute for his tennis podcast (“no challenge remaining”) in spring 2019. they have liked each other ever since. perhaps because they discovered that they are similar, unwaveringly going their way without looking left and right. ""it wa only when i heard nick speak so openly that i really realized how much everyone else is holding back,"" say rothenberg. he would like to tear down this facade. in any case, he won't run out of story that haven't been told or that very few people want to write.

3355,tennis,[oc] visualisation of how nadal's backhand ha performed against (and been targeted by) djokovic across their match at roland garros,"thought i'd make this to test a theory i had. first of all, here is the number of shot nadal ha hit from his backhand side in each rg match v djokovic (i added rome 2011 a well a this wa a year djokovic dominated nadal, but they didn't play at rg). #x200b; [djokovic targeting nadal's backhand more recently](.png?width=1198format=pngauto=webps=fdf6670a94c8ce937c119ef114d5f7b7cea83f3e) it show how **djokovic ha targeted nadal's backhand way, way more in their past 2 roland garros meetings**, to the extent that nadal ha been hitting over half of his shot on his backhand (although i think inside-out forehand also count a backhand side). the number of backhand in 2015 wa interesting, and reflects maybe a lack of confidence from nadal in that shot. the second chart is nadal's backhand performance in these matches. there are 2 plot here: unforced error divided by winner (you want a low number here), and overall % of backhand which were an unforced error. #x200b; [nadal's relatively rubbish backhand in 2021](.png?width=1196format=pngauto=webps=21f44ceacae92921d24ae42f063b67e4ed062028) there are a few thing that stood out to me from this. firstly, **nadal wa amazing in 2020**. despite his backhand being targeted all match, he made almost no error and actually hit more backhand winner than ues. secondly, **his backhand wa very poor in the 2021 match by his standard -** it essentially broke down under djokovic's game**.** he hit *32* *unforced errors* to 4 winners, and 1 in every 10 backhand wa out. the question is, will nadal try to find a way to keep the point on his forehand more, or trust that he can produce another 2020-esque performance? or will djokovic continue to benefit from his clear tactical decision? so it'll be interesting to see what happens when they next play on clay.",1633612753

3452,tennis,i miss justine henin.,"justine henin wa such a magnificent tennis player. there is so much to like about her game. of course, there's her atp style forehand which, while often eclipsed by the beauty of her backhand, wa one of the biggest weapon on tour during her time. justine, of course, wa small and she had to consistently go up against insanely powerful hitter like the williams sisters, davenport and others. her forehand wa so good at dealing with all that power, and doing so while staying close to the baseline. she stalked the baseline (i recall her, almost menacingly, saying ""my baseline"" during interviews) and refused to give an inch to the bigger, stronger women. it wa remarkable to watch her go toe to toe with anyone, fighting off huge powerful shot with her own power and finesse. then of course, there wa that backhand, and it wa such a sweet shot. of course, during justine's prime, the one handed backhand in the women's game wasn't nearly a rare a it is now, but in my opinion, she hit a better 1hbh than any other woman, ever. she could blast passing shot on the run with it. she could come up with sweet, powerful angle when pulled off the court. she could take the ball early, neutralizing power, just like with her forehand. she could slice and dice her opponent into utter frustration. her forehand wa the bigger weapon, but you could write a book of poetry just about her backhand. justine also had quite a powerful serve. while her first serve percentage wa often fairly low, she frequently came up with huge first serf at clutch moments, which wa all the more remarkable considering her height. like ashleigh barty, justine wa able to use every inch of her small frame to come up with huge, clutch serves. her net game wa magnificent. for anyone who watched it (and if you haven't, you should) the 2006 wimbledon final wa an absolute masterpiece of grass court tennis. she may not have won, but mauresmo and henin put on an absolute master class on serve and volley tennis in that final. throughout her career, justine wa an aggressive, all court player whose volleying skill haven't been matched by anyone in recent memory, save the aforementioned amelie mauresmo. her complete all court style, i'd argue, hasn't been matched by anyone in the women's game since she left the game (presumably) for good. lastly, how can we talk about justine without acknowledging her mental strength. this woman wa just so determined to win each and every point. i watched her 2003 uso seminal against capriati live, and she fought, clawed and scraped her way to that victory. she wa cramping, the crowd wa mocking her, capriati wa throwing everything she had at justine, and henin refused to wilt. she closed out the match in a 3rd set tiebreak after 3 plus hours, reportedly couldn't walk and needed fluid injection after the match, and then went out and won the final in straight set two day later. absolutely remarkable. this diminutive powerhouse squeezed every ounce she could out of her frame and managed to win 7 major in the era of ""big babe tennis"" and she did it with a style and flair that hasn't been matched since. now, i must confess, during her prime *i did not like justine henin.* she wa the villain to me. i found many reason to dislike her. i found her cold, her pleading look to her box annoyed me, i refused to forgive her for ""the hand"" or for retiring in the 2006 au final. but what really upset me, to be perfectly honest, wa that she wa just so much better than my favorite player at the time. she beat my favorites, consistently. and that pissed me off. now, i can only dream of a woman playing tennis the way she could in this day and age. i miss justine henin.",1633462504

3570,tennis,some young player you should know about 2020 -- where are they now? part i: atp,"i found [this post from the archives]() on a random search a couple of week back. that post, presenting several promising youngster to look out for, wa written on october 12th 2020. the original poster ha since deleted their account, but i thought it would be fun to do a one-year follow-up anyway. because this is going to be quite a long post, i'm splitting it into three (or possibly four) parts: atp youngster to watch from the 2020 list; the same for the wta; and then a new list of name to look out for in the future. in both the first two, i'll cover all name the op mentioned, in the order presented: those who had already broken through, all the highlighted young players, and the honourable mentions, which i'll expand upon. each player also ha tag (country; age in format years.months; ranking on the 12th october 2020 list; ranking on 4th october 2021 list). hence, for example: **lorenzo musetti** (italy; 19.7; 143; 61) make him 19 year and 7 month old, ranked 143rd on october 12th 2020, and is 61st on the 4th october list. if the original poster ha a new account and want to chip in again, please be my guest! i wish we knew who they were: a will be especially clear in the wta post, they've proven to be something of a brilliant visionary. **2020 (and earlier) breakthroughs** **lorenzo musetti** (italy; 19.7; 143; 61): since last year, when he had a breakthrough at the rome master before picking up a challenger title, musetti ha climbed steadily up the rankings, with his best 2021 result undoubtedly coming at acapulco, losing to tsitsipas in the semi but beating schwartzman and dimitrov on the way, and roland garros, where he took a two-set lead over djokovic but had to retire. since then, he's had a difficult run, losing seven out of his last nine match played, in part [due to personal difficulties](), but ha reached a career-high ranking of 57 recently. also, no further title this year mean that he still ha some way to go before establishing himself a a top force. not yet 20, though, and ha clearly built on last season! let's hope the barren run from the last few month end soon, especially now he's been working with a psychologist to overcome his difficulties. **jannik sinner** (italy; 20.2; 46; 14): sinner's inclusion on the 2020 list owed a lot to his victory at the 2019 nextgen finals, a well a his run to the quarter-finals at the 2020 french open. that saw him reach the top 50. his first two 250 titles, at sofia and melbourne, soon followed, a well a a run to the final of miami, and his biggest title yet at washington in august. just this week, of course, he's defended his sofia title. sinner ha certainly lived up to the billing, and ha surely got plenty more to give. with the absence of nadal, and perhaps even djokovic, from the tour finals, sinner may even have a shot at making the final himself, especially if he can put together a run at indian wells. **young player to watch** **carlos alcaraz** (spain; 18.5; 158; 38): op suggested that hardcore tennis fan should perhaps already have been aware of alcaraz last year. i reckon every tennis fan on the planet know about him now. his 3r victory against tstsipas at the u open wa surely the match of the tournament, and given everything else that wa going on in that fortnight that's some feat. what's more, he built on it by winning his next match too, before injury ended his run. when op included alcaraz last year, he also pointed out that carlos had won two challenger title at 17. literally the very next week, alcaraz made it three, added a fourth just after his 18th birthday, and won his debut atp tour title in umag in july. with such impressive result a a teenager, and such a wonderful style of play too, it's hard not to be excited about ""the next nadal"" alcaraz's future. **jack draper** (uk; 19.10; 295; 277): it's safe to say that 2021 ha been a quiet year for jack. his most notable achievement is beating sinner and bublik at queen's, and at wimbledon he wa able to take a set off djokovic. but outside that, and one final at an itf event, it's been quiet. not everyone can enjoy a spectacular a rise a alcaraz, though, and it may be that injury have played their part in shaping his 2021, since four of his match this season have ended in retirement. hopefully, 2022 will bring greater things. **tseng chun-hsin** (taiwan; 20.2; 284 ; 254): a with draper, 2021 hasn't been a great year for tseng. one itf title in august might have given him the confidence needed to put together another few decent run at challenger recently, though, a he very recently made the top 250. no tour-level appearance to speak of, for the former two-time junior grand slam winner, and it remains to be seen if he will rise any higher. **harold mayot** (france; 19.8; 415; 443): don't be too put off by the apparent backwards movement. mayot's 2021 season didn't even begin until august, presumably due to a long injury lay-off. two semi-finals at the itf level since then actually doesn't seem too bad in that context! if he can stay fit next year, then maybe we'll have a fairer chance to ass his prospect after a full 2022 season a opposed to this year's very truncated one. **holger rune** (denmark; 18.5; 551; 124): after three ""misses"", at least for now, op finally ha another hit! rune ended 2020 and began 2021 by making deep run at itf events, picking up three titles. his tour-level breakthrough at santiago followed (reaching the quarter-finals), along with his first three challenger titles. a couple of decent run at 250 events, and of course his debut slam at the u open -- another player in this list to take a set off djokovic -- will have got more people's attention. what a year for the dane! already a climb of over 400 place in the ranking in a year, and i'd like to think we've found another key name for the future of men's tennis. **shintaro mochizuki** (japan; 18.4; 711; 400): a junior #1 at 16, mochizuki chose to play only adult-level tournament since 2019. ha had some impressive result this year, the stand-out being qualifying for the miami masters. i'd also add to that his first itf final in august, and a decent performance at a recent challenger ha seen his ranking climb to the top 400. a long way to go, and no title at any adult level yet, but a solid 2021 season all the same. more to come? hard to say, but very much going in the right direction. **honourable/special mentions** **eliakim coulibaly** (côte d'ivoire; 19.5; 1710; 640): highlighted last year mainly for being a tennis player from a country without much of a tennis tradition, this wildcard pick hasn't disappointed either! only started his 2021 season in march, and remains at the itf level, but ha won two title and reached a further final to climb into the top 650. i don't know if we can expect much from his future, in particular because he's basically confined to playing in tunisia right now (his one match outside africa, in france, ended in defeat). if r/tennis wanted to [sponsor a player](), though, i'd love for it to be this guy. **martin damm** (usa; 18; 895; 623): the first of two honourable mentions. briefly a #3 junior, and with perhaps a promising double career also (four itf double titles, and a career high of 355), martin ha recently picked up a maiden itf title. turned 18 a few day ago, which is the only reason he's no longer the highest-ranked under-18 player on the tour. hard to ass his future, and is some way behind his fellow 18-year-olds, but may yet be worth keeping an eye on. **arthur cazaux** (france; 19.1; 923; 342): the second honourable mention, cazaux's fine junior career included victory over most of the player on the list above, including alcaraz and rune, and his overall record at junior against the field above is 8-4. his best junior result is the ausopen final in 2020, losing to mayot. a an adult, cazaux ha progressed rapidly up the rankings, primarily on the back of some decent performance at challenger and itf events, with one itf title in december 2020. he's also beaten a few top-100 players, including korda and mannarino. currently the 11th-highest-ranked under-20 player, and third-youngest in the top 350. definitely earned his place in last year's list. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* that concludes the run-down of atp player featured in last year's post. a can be seen, there are four definite hit (musetti, sinner, alcaraz, rune); four player who have done pretty well for themselves, even if they have not yet broken through (mochizuki, coulibaly, damm, cazaux); and only three ""misses"" in draper, tseng, and mayot. and those last three have got plenty of time to improve. not a bad performance for our mysterious u/\[deleted\]!

(i think faster court on the women’s side would be amazing, a the servebotting problem the men face isn’t an issue.) #x200b; i want men’s tennis where grinders, net rushers, serve and volleyers, incessant drop shot abuser , shotmakers, slice gods, and hammer can all win. i just don’t know if it’s possible on the men’s side. i don’t actually find grinder inherently boring, nor serve and volley player inherently boring, what’s boring is when 99% of player all are grinder or svers. #x200b; what do you guy think?",1632849619

3879,tennis,what are your tennis unpopular opinions? i'll start.,"1. djokovic's matchup with similar style player like murray, simon, zverev, medvedev, rba and so on are actually rather exciting instead of boring like most people seem to think. these player can match him in term of consistency and with their ability to suffer in long baseline rallies, so watching them and novak try to figure out way to puncture each other offensively (i.e. with serve, net play, forehand, drop shots) when the rally get too long and physical to sustain is very interesting. 2. federer's backhand is more enjoyable to watch than his forehand. pure technical bliss. 3. marat safin = nick kyrgios in term of style/demeanor. well, similar at least. 4. margaret court doesn't deserve many of her 24 grand slams. if anyone deserves to be called a weaker era champion, she does. a doe rod laver to an extent. 5. hyeon chung, had he not run into all the injury woe he had, would have been the next big thing. he wa the answer to djokovic in term of movement but he actually had a big forehand which most of the younger generation of today lacked. 6. woman should play bo5. more precisely, men should play bo3 in the first four round of a grand-slam, and in the final stages, play bo5. so should the women. 7. double should be given more screen-time/watch-time. it's an underrated part of tennis. 8. rafael nadal's backhand defence wa a good a novak djokovic's in his prime on hard courts. not better by any means, but a good. 9. monica seles, had she not suffered that horrific stabbing, would have been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, female tennis player of all time. she could match and even beat steffi graf at slams, wa super consistent in term of results, and had the game to dominate the tour at a level only matched by graf, williams and evert/navratilova. 10. andy murray, if he had a better or more devastating forehand, would have beaten novak djokovic in at least one of the ao match they played (they played in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016 and he lost all), and would have had a chance to beat djokovic in that french open final they played in 2016. the way the match went is that too often, murray would try to outlast/outgrind djokovic, which worked on occasion (like in their 2012 match), but murray just wasn't a good a grinder a novak. he would get tired out by the end while novak would be jumping around like a jackrabbit because of his more devastating forehand which ran murray around the court, tiring him out while he wa fresher because he did le running. 11. zverev is a fucking tool. not sure why so many people like him a a player/person. 12. woman tennis player don't deal with slice all that well. we have to state it at a point. it come down to the fact that they don't get down with their forehand and generate enough aggressive topspin like a thiem or nadal on the men's tour can. not sure why? i think chris evert once summarized that it come down to the fact that woman have le pronounced/strong forearm and hips, possibly to do with the fact that they are for childbearing. please don't flame me in the comment over this, evert is right. it's basic biology. do you agree or disagree with any of the unpopular opinion i've written here? please let me know in the comments. also, what are your tennis unpopular opinions?",1632826311
3880,tennis,grip size l2 to l3,"hi, i've recently bought a new racket. i used to play with grip size l3 and a wilson pro overgrip. the total circumference wa about 11.7 cm and this felt perfect for me. the new racket wa only available in grip size l2 and i figured i could increase the grip size by buying [this heat-shrink sleeve](-griffschlauch-verpakking-1-stuk-zwart-1457380006200000.html). i removed the base grip, applied the sleeve with a heat gun, applied a new base grip and a new wilson overgrip. the problem is that the circumference is now 12 cm and feel too large. i tried to solve the issue by removing the sleeve and applying an extra thin overgrip with a wilson overgrip, which came to a perfect 11.7 cm. however, now i cannot feel the bevel enough for my taste. is it possible that the sleeve i bought wa simply too thick? or can i solve this issue another way? thank you!",1632822846

3921,tennis,insight into monica seles,"i wa reading youtube comment on a seles youtube match video. one user had some enlightening comment on her career trajectory. do you all feel a though this person had any valid points? see below. i hate to barge again into this choir. but it is high time to dispel this rampant common belief: no, it wa not the knife that punctured monica seles' teenage triumphant success. this is a common fallacy that is easy to believe because it's simple and vivid. the wound wa a very light one, and didn't do any serious damage. it required only two stitches. monica seles never displayed a photo of the wound, nor later wa she willing to show a picture of the scar. a journalist once asked her, tongue in cheek, to remove her shirt and let everybody see the famous scar. she published all the medical report on her assailant günther parche. but she never published her own medical report from the surgeon in vail or from the psychologist in lake tahoe. the german lawyer had no difficulty proving that the injury wa slight, and parche’s intent not deeply criminal. yes, monica seles could have been killed, or, even worse, paralyzed. but she didn't. she just got immensely lucky. the two surgeon in vail thought she could be back in action in about 5 months. and her brain circuits, those that control the dynamic of her shot were not destroyed either. her hard hitting style didn't disappear at all. look, she even won her next (and 9th) grand slam right after her return from a 28-month withdrawal. an unexpected win which, by the way, proved to be another piece of good luck for her. what destroyed her wa her emotional reaction, her unbalanced interpretation of the incident, her incessant convoluted rumination on all the aspect of the stabbing and it complex consequences, her obsessive lamenting about her tragic fate, and her sinking into a pervasive depression — all the classical sign of a ptsd. she wa left mired in months-long sulking and feeling sorry for herself that turned into years. the physical wound wa nowhere a serious and debilitating a the depth of her mental upset. the higher you climb, the harder is the fall. she felt her life had suddenly been utterly shattered. young monica never considered counting her blessings, how lucky all her life had been, including escaping any serious injury from the stabbing attack, being transported two day later by private medical plane across the atlantic all the way to vail, getting examined immediately by top doctors, and all those great wonderful thing tennis and america had brought into her life. monica had come to believe she lived in a tennis wonderland where she had become de facto the princess of the game, winning practically any grand slam tournament she entered. and, lo and behold, without her the tennis world wa now still going on, and very well. that wa oh so grossly unfair, so she felt. there wa a mistake somewhere that she couldn't accept and tried in vain to rectify mentally. so everybody in the game wa now acting a if she no longer wa that important, right? no longer a dominant force on the tour? no longer entitled to the no. 1 ranking? so she wa going to show them and quit this game that didn't value her a highly a she deserved. it wa to be their loss, they'll miss her and the brilliance and excitement of her play once she wa gone. she wa behaving, without knowing it, like nixon when he resigned; or achilles raging in his tent, nursing his personal grievance and refusing to join the greek army besieging troy. again, monica wa acting in a well-known, standard psychological play of anger and resentment, of moaning, moping and sulking, like the spoiled child she in fact still was. she stopped practicing — a fatal decision of self-sabotaging. not even going out for walks, simply sitting on the couch glued to the tv set, learning english from cartoons, forgetting her mental pain by stuffing her face with the ordinary junk food from neighborhood stores. over those two long year of bingeing she gradually managed to lose her adolescent gaunt frame and join the rank of vastly overweight americans. that wa monica seles's only visible sign of finally embracing american culture. the flying wallendas, famous german-american high-wire artists, have a key, imperative rule: after a fall, immediately, get back on the wire. don't let fear paralyze you. if monica had reacted more normally, like an adult with mettle and courage — like petra kvitova would after a more serious knifing attack later on in 2016 — if she had gone back to the court a soon a feasible, and drowned her sorrow in 6-hour hitting sessions, she very well could have competed in the 1993 u open, and probably also in the year-end wta final at msg. no, it wa not the knife that stopped monica seles, it wa her being lost in a fantasy of being the unique queen of tennis without whom the tennis world had no right to go on. her list of grievance wa longer than achilles'. the hamburg tournament had continued after the stabbing a if nothing had happened! her no.1 ranking wa not maintained in her absence from the wta tour! the german court accepted the defense of günther parche's lawyer and let him practically go free! she wa losing her sponsorship and endorsement to her competitors! they now were winning all those other grand slam that were her due! how could that be? her whole world wa crumbling down. why did everything suddenly turn away from her, abandoning her, the superstar of the tennis world? how wa all that nightmarish sequence of disaster possible, right after her sensational series of triumphs? it wa 19-year old monica's lack of maturity, her juvenile disappointment and day dreaming that fed a growing depression and stopped her phenomenal career in it brilliant tracks. everything had been going so magically well for her until now, she had been living in such a fairy-tale a if protected by the gods, that she never had had the chance to face adversity and build up any fiber of resilience. all true tennis champion have had their ups and downs, their personal tragedies. but none underwent the kind of radical metamorphosis in mind and body that became monica’s strange, kafka-style, fate. always the odd case, she wa the only one to go off the deep end and lose control of her sanity and figure, and to abandon training. unlike agassi, who revealed the depth of his trouble in his gripping memoirs, or sharapova, who survived childhood poverty and a career-threatening 15-month suspension due to a failed drug test, or kvitova, who suffered a far more serious knifing attack, or venus williams, beset by medical problems, monica alone simply let herself drown into her psychological and physical collapse. she had never learnt how to swim in a sea of troubles. it wa also, in an inseverable part, a result of the sad resignation and lazy laissez-faire of a father/coach, already enfeebled by cancer, who wa too lenient and permissive, too worried about damaging his beloved daughter's fragile mental balance — his reluctance to crack the whip in order to bring her back to reality, to remind her that there were no way she could hope to remain a towering champion without discipline and hard daily practice, above all maintaining that winning 118 lb figure, and working tirelessly on mobility and endurance. this return to reality eventually happened, after 28 month of absurd moping and irrational withdrawal. the hitting style wa still there, but the full strength and amazingly sharp precision of her shot could not have survived intact after such a long inactivity of her essential muscles. impossible to imagine, and sad to contemplate, but sylph-like 117 lb monica had been metamorphosed into an obese player soon to balloon up to 175 lb in 1997, in some kind of grotesque “sumo wrestler” caricature — the only unprecedented and aberrant case on the professional women's tour. nothing wa ever normal in monica seles’s career. with that new incarnation came reduced mobility, and loss of reliable endurance in long matches. in the cold light of tournaments, the new monica no longer wa the same dominant star she had been during her four year of teenage glory. try a she might, it proved for her impossible to recover the fine-tuning of her former prodigious form. and, through the torturous mistreatment she inflicted on her young body at such a critical age — rapid and forced yoyo-like up-and-down gyration of weight — she may have suffered some invisible damage to the very engine of her vitality (heart, kidneys, lungs, bones, feet, etc... who knows, such thing were never revealed). all this radically eliminated her chance for the extraordinary record that could have been hers. again, once and for all, it wa not the knife of the april 30, 1993 stabbing in hamburg that did the undoing of monica seles superstar. it wa the immature mind of an ignorant adolescent who had never learnt anything about the real world except hitting tennis ball against a wall and whatever her adored and adoring dad had been drumming into her from their overly secretive and distrustful hungarian cultural background. he cultivated monica’s passion for hitting tennis balls, and cleverly fed her love of fun and excitement with his cartoons, turning every practice session into a playful game. no strict disciplinarian, he didn't inculcate his young daughter with a taste for regular workout nor surmounted her profound dislike for running and other athletic training. he neglected developing in the young girl the so-called ""executive function"", exercising the frontal lobe of her brain in charge of keeping control on her impulses, taming her wild instincts, and focusing on building up efficient habit of personal life management. she sabotaged herself, trusting nobody, including experts, sharing her anxiety and fear with no one, behaving exactly like an uneducated teenager who persistently lived following the unpredictable cue of her own extreme emotion and unchecked weird imagination — from which monica seles probably never completely escaped. the great enigma. revisiting thirty year later this sensational ""mano a mano"" between those two juvenile promoter of the power game in women’s tennis, — a truly historical match of fighting passion where the two adolescent keep pouring all the boundless energy of youth into every shot — there are the same two vexing question that keep again spontaneously haunting the mind of a fervent admirer of teenager monica seles's so brilliant and exciting play. that this young monica had been an extraordinary player, a breath of fresh air in the stultifying atmosphere of serve and volley, and abuse of the boring sliced backhand wa obvious to all during seles’s glory day from 1989 all through 1993. but that she reappeared in 1995, at the still young age of 21, a a markedly diminished player wa also sadly obvious to everyone in the tennis world. how and why did young prodigy monica seles come to put her remarkable, unique, revolutionary talent into hibernation in a sarasota storage room, drop out of competition and practice at a most critical time of growth for what seemed like an eternity, to reemerge on the court having lost the fantastic sense of precision, the tremendous accuracy, and good endurance of her triumphant day and become relegated into the handful of player struggling to maintain a spot in the top-10 rankings? how and why did this superior, dominant, phenomenal talent degraded so much and nearly vanished so dramatically? and this abrupt change, lamented upon by all, became ever since an intriguing challenge to commenters and expert alike. they were all eager to exercise their journalistic perspicacity and delighted with the opportunity to expatiate at great length to make sense of what appeared to have been a real metamorphosis. they were not always assisted by the fuzzy explanation of the new monica, a young woman raised in the tightly-controlled old yugoslavia, and addicted to keeping her secret thought to herself. thinking clearly and expressing her feeling convincingly had not been anyway the forte of the giggling, bubbling, and gabbing youngster, still poorly educated, unsure of her word in english, and emotionally fragile. this remains the nagging enigma that any reflecting observer still find disturbing and perplexing. but also fascinating, and perhaps, thirty year after the facts, worth taking a little more time to investigate, research thoroughly, get a closer look, and, who knows? hopefully elucidate. the owl of athene take her flight at night, when the battle is over, and the body can be counted.",1632768496

4052,tennis,"are the tennis goats, djokovic, nadal and federer, the greatest athlete of all time","first of all, tennis is my 2nd favourite sport, my first being basketball so any bias i may have i consider minimal. if you just think about the goat from all across sports, jordan/lebron in basketball, brady/rice in gridiron, messi/ronaldo from football, gretzky in hockey, phelps in swimming etc. i think the goat of tennis, being djokovic, nadal and federer are the greatest athlete ever. first of all, tennis is an individual support, you rely on urself to win and you do all the work by yourself. you win because of how good u are and not anyone else. furthermore you compete the longest out of any sport, making it one of the most taxing sport if not the most. now if you just use the average of those 3's accomplishment it 20 grand slams, 33 master 1000s, 4 atp finals. i mean thats just ridiculous if you compare it to the other goat in their respective sports. i mean just think about the amount of point you need to win a match, then you need to win a match 7 time to win just one grand slam. these guy have done that 20 time and thats just the grand slams. think of all the point needed to win those 37 master and atp' finals. oh and i haven't counted the amount of 250s and 500 they've won so add that in their a well. now i know some people, or most, don't have that much knowledge on the other goat i mentioned beforehand but trust me, they definetely did not win this much. i know people will say ""oh tennis ha way more opportunity to win"" but even so these 3's accomplishment to me surpass every other goat even when taking that into account. and one of the most important thing i haven't mentioned is that their doing this in the same time a each other, winning more than anyone ha ever before. i mean imagine just placing say federer in the 80-mid 90s, nadal in the mid 90s- 2010, djokovic in 2010-now, theyd prolly have like 30 grand slam 50 master 1000 and so on because they wouldn't be in each other's way. it just kind of ridiculous.",1632636178
4053,tennis,i (a 1hbh player of 15+ years) played a practice game tonight where i returned with a 2hbh - omg i'm never going back.,"a my skill ha improved i find myself playing opponent with stronger serves, and i've noticed that it's so freaking difficult to get my racket in front of me on a 1 handed backhand return. in addition, if you mistime it, you'll shank it into the fence. whereas the guy i play that have 2hbh's often time shank the shit out of it, but because they have two hand on it they're able to frame it back into the court. i used to hit with a two hander for maybe a year like 10 year ago, so i have the mechanic somewhere in my brain. but holy hell. i haven't hit a two hander since then and tonight my backhand return game felt so much better doing a two hander. which kind of piss me off. like, how the fuck can i work on a shot for 10 fucking years, only to try a new shot and within 60 second it's better than the 10 year old one (for return at least.) give me time to set up on a 1 hander and i'll molest it.",1632632045

4056,tennis,should team world be embarrassed ?,"i know that this is just for fun and it ha no impact on point but do you think that they should be embarrassed? i think they might even laugh it out at themselves because this tournament is just a stomp. it’s not that bad if they just lose but team world ha been hyping up point and just giving u teaser only to lose it at the most crucial time ( faa, isner, diego, doubles) along with the bagel a well from shapo (which is team world number 1 seed lol). also notable mention from opelka and kyrgios. no hate just friendly discussion because i do think team world wanted to win because of what zverev said a well being the last point they would win. but it’s also good to put into account that most of team europe is just simply in form. you have ruud coming off a beast clay season winning 3 title in a row and catapulting to 10 rank and medvedev winning u open along with zverev coming off that olympics + master win. but even with rublev, berrettini , tsitipas, they have had very good season compared to team worlds…. diego losing to a unranked in davis cup. isner , kyrgios barely in form and shapo , faa not consistent a well. opelka also can only win against people who can’t return his serve and everyone on team europe are excellent returners. it wa just funny to me because i really would’ve liked it to be close but it wa more just a teaser and the more they lose the more i just thought that maybe it’s just because that it’s unlucky cause team europe are crazy in form right now.",1632630313

4145,tennis,the rublev rant: part ii,"the first part of the rublev rant ended up being kinda vague, mainly because it wa late and i started to fall asleep, so i kinda just lamented rublev's game and lack of strategy, but i want to get more in-depth with it. to do this, i want to first look at rublev's match against next-gen opposition who he really struggle with, mainly, world number two and u open champion daniil medvedev, and world number four and u open chokeian alexander zverev. then, i want to talk about the best strategy rublev could employ. **daniil medvedev** watching rublev - medvedev clash fascinates me. rublev hit the ball hard, but almost aimlessly. point with medvedev break down into three major category (excluding aces, unreturned serves, and double faults.) 1) the grind point. in this point, rublev will hit down the middle for a while, hit a middling shot cross court, then aggressively go cross court. rublev is hesitant to ever change direction, and when he does, he frequently make errors, or he hit a bad error. the second way this point end is with medvedev setting up angle that disrupt rublev's rhythm; rublev either end up near the net, where he's completely out of position to do anything but watch medvedev hit a passing shot winner or rublev manages to retrieve the volley, only for rublev's volley to either suck or go out. on rare occasion, rublev will find his confidence, and can hit a big down the line shot which can medvedev on the defensive, from here, there's still no guarantee, a if rublev get up to the net, there's a good chance he seriously fuck up. but, most of the time, rublev doe manage to win after a big down the line bweh shot. the grind point work for rublev about 20% of the time, but because of medvedev's better physical fitness and movement, rublev's grind point get progressivley poorer, and wield diminishing returns. 2) the nervous point. here, rublev will just keep hitting down the middle, with a lot of power. a lot of the times, against medvedev, even with easy winners, rublev will just hit the ball down the middle, allowing medvedev to hit an angled shot or a lob to force rublev to defend himself, from here, medvedev is in control of the point, and will use controlled aggression to eliminate rublev from the rally procedurally. alternatively, rublev will keep hitting down the middle, while medvedev drag rublev around the court - the most frustrating thing, is that medvedev give rublev angle-opportunities, which rublev just doesn't take. 3) the octopus point. this is a point where medvedev serves, or get a big return. once medvedev asserts an early dominance over the point, rublev just ha nothing; medvedev us variety and angles, with some drop-shots and pace change to basically exhaust rublev before eventually winning the point. rublev's serve and lack of positioning + mediocre return and nervous point are exploited by medvedev, leading to the russian bear pulling out the victory, barring weird cameras. **alexander zverev** interestingly, what happens to rublev against medvedev also happens to rublev against zverev. like, literally, i feel like rublev - medvedev and rublev - zverev are the same exact matches. rublev play his grind point, and his nervous point, and zverev ha his equivalent to the octopus shot. rublev's nerves, lack of positioning, and serve + return are still exploited. **what rublev need to improve:** confidence, volleys, drop shot controlled aggression. **some good strategy for rublev:** 1) the triangle pattern. rublev already us this sometimes, but against big opponents, he could employ the triangle pattern, whih focus on controlled aggression. basically, it work like this: rublev hit forehand cross court, then hit to the other side, and he just keep going back and fourth. this point is great, and he already us this a bit, but more is needed than just power to optimize this strategy. a lot of times, your opponent, if you use this method, will end up hitting a weak shot, and once at the net, one should be able to end the point - this is where volley improvement is huge. 2) the drop shot. adding this change in rhythm is great. the drop shot lob combination is brutal, and against big opponents, very effective. grinding with zverev and medvedev is futile, so rublev need to change up points, adding drop shots, slices, and confusing short angle are all very good. 3) be crazy! in every match, rublev should do a bit of serve and volley, chip and charge a second serve, rush the net a couple times, just stop being so predictable. rublev's opponent can basically always expect what rublev will do, which is a major liability. adding some crazy point should help. **immediate goal for rublev: controlled aggression, shotmaking, confidence** **next couple seasons: net game, slice** **long term: game plan and analytical skills.**",1632566733

4175,tennis,the rublev rant,"i first discovered andrey rublev during the 2019 u open, when he beat stefanos tsitsipas, followed by eliminating nick kyrgios to make the fourth round. the first ever rublev performance i saw wa his match against kyrgios; rublev won in three passionate sets: 76(5), 76(5), 63. immediately, i identified upsides, and downsides: he had good aggression, but not nearly like he doe today, and his volleys, second serve, and slice were non-existent, not to mention how painfully mediocre his backhand was. i ebulliently followed rublev a he ascended, winning qatar and adelaide, i watched a zverev eliminated him at the 2020 australian open, and once again, i couldn't help but notice that he wa just being outclassed: zverev had a bigger serve, le power, but strangely, bigger weapons, better variety, and somehow, even a better (or really, a le worse) second serve. when the tour kicked up again, i watched a rublev lost to medvedev in the u open quarterfinals, despite a six to zero lead in the first set tiebreak. medvedev ground rublev, neutralizing rublev's one dimensional game viciously and effectively. the latter half of 2020 would bring rublev his first atp 500 title, followed by two more in quick succession, rublev would reach the quarterfinal of the french open, where tsitsipas - whom rublev had edged out in hamburg, just a week before their french open clash - outclassed rublev. rublev ascended into the top eight, bursting into the atp finals, where he wa promptly outclassed by nadal, and mentally imploded against tsitsipas, before winning against a thiem who didn't even want to try. rublev ended the tournament, and the year, ranked number eight, joyous, optimistic, and saying, at the conclusion of the year-end finals, ""i am the one who cannot complain."" i watched excitedly a rublev obliterated his competition in the atp cup, toppling competent opponent such a fognini effortlessly. once again, rublev would be outclassed by a fellow next-gen player in the australian open, with medvedev delivering the kill this time: once again, rublev's power wa neutered by medvedev's defense and return. rublev then obliterated the field in rotterdam, hitting with the greatest power of his career, prompting tsitsipas to helplessly scream, ""so much power!"" qatar and dubai would end with close loses to fellow tough opponents, and a very windy day in miami plus some inspired tennis from hurkacz ended rublev's early hard court season with a miami semifinal loss to hubert hurkacz, the eventual miami champion. in monte carlo, rublev played the best tennis i've ever seen him play. first, rublev beat rba in one of the most intense clash of the year, and then, rublev eliminated rafael nadal - the king of clay, at monte carlo - in a grueling three set classic. rublev and ruud played two close sets, but ultimately, rublev got the better of the norwegian. rublev announced after his win over ruud that he wa taking a wild-card into barcelona, which wa to begin right after monte carlo. gassed from three tense battles, rublev flopped against tsitsipas, who had cruised to the final. now, we begin, the slump. tired, rublev would get whooped by sinner. then, isner would frustrate and wear down a still sluggish rublev. in rome, sonego would play exhilarating tennis to oust the russian, a terrible first round match to struff, and a mediocre grass season would send rublev into the hard court season with modest expectations. rublev entered toronto, looked decent against fognini, and then, just crumbled against isner. in cincinnati, rublev played pretty poor tennis, but still managed to make the final. rublev beat medvedev in the cincinnati semifinals, but really, medvedev beat himself - going ballistic after an occurence with a certain camera. zverev promptly obliterated rublev, outhitting, outstrategizing, and outgrinding rublev. tiafoe would then play a scintillating match, and rublev, playing sub-optimally, would ultimately lose to tiafoe in five set during the third round of the u open. then, there wa tonight's match against diego schwartzman. rublev won, but god damn, it really felt like a hollow victory. rublev made so many errors, played so predictably, and jesus, at the net, he disappointed, every single time. i want to talk about the rublev game plan, the upsides, the down sides, and what i like to call, the rublev cycle. #x200b; **upside: the forehand** perhaps rublev's biggest upside is his forehand - the power and spin rublev can get on a good day with that forehand rival the like of nadal and thiem. against most lower ranked players, rublev can whap the forehand a couple times, and essentially end the rally right there. unfortunately, rublev doesn't always position the forehand very well, but more on that later. rublev's forehand almost never break down, it's reliable, controlled, it's tempered, it's melded, it's a complete stroke. **downside: the return** rublev's return consistently disappoints me. it's no secret that big server challenge rublev immensely, in fact, when asked about having to play paire, who had eliminated john isner - arguably the greatest server of all time, although karlovic is unbelievable, too - rublev said, ""at least it's not isner."" rublev's return is just meager. compared to medvedev, or even tsitsipas, rublev's return isn't there. rublev's return is weak, and a lot of his return go straight into the net. **upside: first serve** rublev's first serve is pretty impressive. when rublev is in the zone, he can blast ace like roddick, federer, or isner; i have seen rublev play immaculate service games. on big points, rublev love going huge with the first serve, and when those gargantuan serf smash into the court, most returners have little to no chance of respectably getting the ball in play. **downside: second serve** while, rublev's first serve is monstrous, rublev's second serve is almost timid. (and yet rublev still manages to double fault often.) rublev's second serve doesn't have a lot of raw power, nor doe it have tricky positioning - rublev play second serf so nervously, and ironically, those nerve just make rublev double fault more, a he is tight, and not completely focused on the ball. rublev's second serve is so exploitable, and player like medvedev can basically pummel rublev's second serve with blistering returns, often time faster than the serve. **upside and downside: spirit** rublev ha huge fighting spirit, which, for all player of that ""big heart, big game"" breed (tiafoe, rublev, pcb - who when on, is shockingly aggressive - berrettini, shapovalov.) is both a liability and a strength. rublev can generate astonishing get and huge winner under pressure; but he can also succumb to double faults, nerves, and cycle of error and anger. **downside: touch, volley, slice, finesse, positioning** rublev's biggest weakness come here: he ha such bad vollies, a terrible slice, and limited shotmaking. rublev is so predictable: he grind you, but he ha nothing else. rublev ha so few tool in his toolbox: it's laughable. #x200b; so, what should andrey do? 1) develop a plan b. one issue for rublev is that when he start to lose, he ha no solution other than upping his power, which is almost useless. first of all, hitting with even more power than rublev already doe requires so much effort, and often necessitates rublev leaning in on the ball, leading to overhits, and pushing the racquet foreword instead of up. rublev also tends to lose focus a lot in his ""mindless bashing"" phase when losing, and then get extremely frustrated. a realistic plan b for rublev would involve taking fewer risks, and throwing in more variety. 2) variety. speaking of variety, rublev really need this: his game is so predictable, it's just pathetic. rublev doesn't throw in dropshots, slices, change in pace (besides going from normal to bweh!) or really anything else. rublev is like the guy at the club who beat everyone the first time, but then get figured out. rublev need to keep opponent guessing. a good example of adding variety would be medvedev - medvedev is a huge grinder, but even he'll add dropshots, change of pace, and will at least attempt to conquer some cheap point at the net. fognini, on the other hand, brilliantly deploys shotmaking to keep opponent confused, and out of their comfort zones. 3) curb the losing cycle. rublev ha this vicious cycle, which i touched on earlier: start to lose, hit harder, make more errors, get frustrated, subsequently lose focus, make more errors, lose match. (unless your opponent in schwartzman, who just kinda disappeared.) when rublev start to lose, he need to adapt, he need to tinker, he need to use his imagination, he need to keep his opponent on the move, uncomfortable, and guessing, but more importantly, he need to keep morale up. some sport psychology could really help rublev. (i've actually watched the rublev documentary, and rublev open up on his struggle with depression, and that guy ha struggled a lot, especially with confidence / self-belief.) #x200b; rublev need to define himself. what doe he want to be? he can be another boring, mid-tier baseliner, who can go deep in slam and masters, but walk away with minimal trophies. a far a the power game goes, rublev get outclassed by thiem, zverev, and medvedev, who all practice **controlled aggression.** (aggression with a plan; it seems like rublev can only hit the ball smart, or hit the ball hard, not both simultaneously.) rublev's serve get outclassed by berrettini, zverev, medvedev, and perhaps even tsitsipas. rublev's forehand is outclassed by medvedev, zverev, and berrettini. rublev's touch is obliterated by everyone, and his second serve rival zverev in grand slam finals. however, rublev can get the most raw power of the next gen. rublev need to harness his power, and work on adding three strategies: **controlled aggression: set up the point, procedurally build pace, crush opponents' rhythm.** **free points: serve and volley, well position winners, aces, otherwise unreturnable serves, drop shot winners, lob winners.** **creative grinding: grind with an escape plan; medvedev and zverev can out-grind rublev, so rublev need to find a way out of the grind style he's embraced.** #x200b; rublev is a player with huge up-side, his easy power is astonishingly, and always amazes me, however, he need to work on adapting. rublev could be a world number one, seasoned grand slam champion, but to do so, i think he'll actually have to go down first, he need to start experimenting: start rushing the net, start messing around with angles, start building point in creative ways, work on the lob, try out chip and charge + serve and volley, work on changing pace. and of course, hit some point with crazy raw power: rublev's bwehing is fine, if the bwehing is infrequent. rublev might have to lose a fair bit in order to improve these weaker element of his game (after all, his volleys, for example, will probably let him down until he's improved them by using them a lot more.) rublev ha all the tool necessary to succeed, he just need both the confidence to experiment, accepting that he might lose before he start to win, and he also need the mental headspace necessary to keep control of the match. (i think a lot of the bweeehing is a result of anger, and might not even really be a conscious decision on rublev's part.) if rublev can master controlled aggression, and versatility, then he will be the best in the world. i know these point seem obvious, but i am so sick of seeing rublev collapse into power. i leave you with this, the step rublev should take: **1) spend the rest of the season working on hitting with angles; constructing better shot shouldn't be too hard, a rublev ha already demonstrated that he can hit with good angles.** **2) hire a sport psychologist. i don't want to see rublev enter self-destruct, mindless power mode, and i also hate seeing the passive tennis he play against medvedev and zverev, and against virtually anyone in big matches.** **3) spend the off week developing volleys, while still spending some time keeping the bweh stroke polished** **4) use the 2022 season a a testing ground: enter lot of 250s, experiment, build confidence, build adaptation** **5) if all go well in 2022, use the 2022-2023 off period to focus on slice and lob. use the 2023 season to focus on bringing everything together. hopefully rublev's confidence and tennis iq will be higher by then.** ***the big takeaway: rublev need to experiment. he need to develop three to five method of winning points, and stronger improv skills. i think vincente is a good coach, but he need more. fix the volleys, then the second serve, then the drop shot, then brush up on the slice, and hopefully by mid-to-late 2023, rublev will be ready to climb to the top of the rankings!***",1632538929

4445,tennis,grand slam champion without the big 3 - the math,"inspired by the [murray without the big 3 - the maths]() post which attempted to calculate how many hypothetical grand slam murray would have won had the big 3 not been in picture. **tl;dr** using ultimate tennis statistic hypothetical matchup winner of g title were predicted, and the table of winner is given from 2003 onwards. **introduction** first of all it is important to point out that this result is achieved by applying the rule described below, **it doe not take a an input any personal opinions/predictions.** that said, i have no way of knowing that this methodology is going to produce the most accurate result (the same way no one else can claim that about any other methodology, a we can never know for sure). my wish with this post is to attempt to apply some math on a real world problem, not to push any agendas. **methodology** similarly to the original post, [ultimate tennis statistics]() hypothetical matchup function is used to predict the result of a match. a for which tournament are considered, the following applies: \-any tournament before wimbledon 2003 is considered unchanged. i don't think many people would object to this assumption. \-any tournament from wimbledon 2003 onwards that ha been won by someone other than a big 3 member is considered unchanged. this point could be contested, but i wa of the belief that if someone else won a g in the big 3 era, they deserve to keep it in this hypothetical scenario. this leaf u with 60 tournament to consider. next, all of the tournament that were given to murray by the original post were also given to him here. in actuality, if the methodology were applied to these tournament a well murray would end up a the victor either way. now for the rest, we make three assumptions: 1. if a big 3 member didn't make it to the quarterfinal of a tournament, nothing change 2. if a big 3 member wa present in a qf, it is assumed that his opponent won the match 3. match that happened in our timeline not involving the big 3 don't change their result the only two grand slam where 2 of the big 3 have met in the quarterfinal are 2006 and 2015 french open (both of them being contested between djokovic and nadal). i already gave the fo15 to stan wawrinka a the real-life winner, so we have to consider only the fo06. we will assume that ivan ljubicic made it to the final a the semi-finalist that went against nadal. now let's look at the prediction using the 2008 wimbledon championship a the example. first quarterfinal wa between federer and mario ancic. we assume that ancic won this match, a it is a quarterfinal. second quarterfinal is between marat safin and feliciano lopez. a safin won this match in our timeline, we assume this stay the same. similarly, the winner of the third quarterfinal is rainer schuettler. the fourth qf wa contested between nadal and murray, so we assume murray won that match. we are left with the following semis: ancic - safin schuttler - murray now that we have 2 match that didn't happen in our timeline, we use the hypothetical matchup function. the result are following: **ancic** **61% - 39% safin** **schuettler 21% - 79% murray** now, we assume that the more likely winner **always** win a matchup. we end up with ancic - murray final. the result is **ancic 49.6% - 50.4% murray.** the winner of wi08 is andy murray. i have chosen this tournament a an example because of how different the result is to the original post, which only give murray a 20% shot at winning the tournament. first notable difference is the absence of player that didn't make it to qf, hewitt and youzhny. next, murray doesn't require a 50% chance of winning a tournament in order to win it, rather he just need to get through his matchup one by one. this final match-up in particular is very close, so the real result would probably be much more random. that said, this methodology doe give u the most likely winner of the tournament. while statistically, according to the original post, murray would have won further 10 tournament had the big 3 been out of the picture, he is the **most likely winner** of further 15 grand slams, on top of his 3. this would make him the winner of 18 total g titles, the most of any male player in single category. he would also win a calendar grand slam in 2011, and a three-quarter calendar grand slam in 2012 and 2016. **results** [grand slam alternate timeline](.png?width=1470format=pngauto=webps=90ce2994375d63bd030db180a8b7d608fc59010f) i believe there are some people that will find these result interesting, a have i, and some that will try to dispute them. i am in no way trying to say that these would certainly be the results. all discussion is welcomed. **conclusion** the result were achieved with me entering all the match-up by hand, so it is entirely possible that i have made a mistake here and there, sadly i am not a good enough coder to write a script to do this for me. if i was, it would have been possible to simulate all the tournament in the atp tour, a well a to change the seed in tournament in accordance to new winners. an interesting result could be achieved by selecting a winner randomly with the probability given by the hypothetical matchup function, maybe even simulating the entire atp tour, looking at week at number 1, most master titles... my conclusion is that this is a very interesting mathematical concept, but it is nothing more than that. it is an intriguing exercise (at least it is intriguing to me), but it doe not show u anything of real-world application. there is no way to know how the psyche or retirement plan or injury would change had the big 3 been out of picture, nor do i believe it is a productive discussion. ultimately, they were here and have (so far) won 60 grand slam titles. i don't think there is any tennis fan that wish they never played the game.",1632317340

4534,tennis,murray without the big 3 - the math,"inspired by the [if, if, if ... doesn't exist.](?utm_source=shareutm_medium=web2xcontext=3) meme post about murray's chance without the big3, i decided to do the maths. **some notes** \- we can work this out by using the probability of winning each slam in which he lost against a member of the big 3 (after removing them), and adding the number together. we replace the big3 member with the most likely alternative based on the draw. \- in order to calculate the probability of winning a match i am using the hypothetical matchup feature within [) \- this is purely looking at the math using a simple model. we are not interested here in whether murray wa able to raise his level without them around, or whether other player raised their game to match murray. these are valid point but do not belong here. \- where murray beat a member of the big3 we give him this win regardless. we are only looking at the losses. the meme is unclear a to whether we are only removing one of the big 3, or all 3 so i'll calculate for both. **without federer** instead of becoming a 20 slam champion, and having nightmare of the number 40 and 15, roger instead becomes a tour guide and spends his day hiking around the alps. **us open 2008:** murray face djokovic in the final and ha a **35%** chance of winning. **aus open 2010:** murray face davydenko in the final and ha a **57%** chance of winning. **wimbledon 2012:** murray face djokovic in the final and ha a **38%** chance of winning. **aus open 2014:** murray face tsonga in the qf (**74%**), nadal in the sf (**28%**), and wawrinka in the final (**67%**). probability of winning the slam is **14%**. **wimbledon 2015:** murray face simon in the sf (**85%**), and djokovic in the final (**41%**). probability of winning the slam is **35%.** adding these together give a total of **1.78** more slam for murray if federer never became a pro. most likely he win ao2010 and probably (if we round up) wimbledon 2012. **without nadal** instead of becoming a 13 time french open champion, and a star of 25625656 capybara memes, nadal becomes a professional footballer. **aus open 2007:** murray face wawrinka in the 4r (**69%**), gonzalez in the qf (**40%**), haas in the sf (**46%)**, and federer in the final (**9%**). probability of winning the slam is **1%** **wimbledon 2008:** murray face youzhny in the qf (**56%**), schuettler in the sf (**79%**) and federer in the final (**12%**). probability of winning the slam is **5%** **wimbledon 2010:** murray face soderling in the sf (**66%**) and berdych in the final (**62%**). probability of winning the slam is **41%** **french open 2011:** murray face soderling in the sf (**49%**) and federer in the final (**31%**). probability of winning the slam is **15%** **wimbledon 2011:** murray face fish in the sf **(69%)** and djokovic in the final **(50%).** probability of winning the slam is **35%** **us open 2011:** murray face roddick in the sf (**78%**) and djokovic in the final (**26%**). probability of winning the slam is **20%** **french open 2014:** murray face ferrer in the sf (**39%**) and djokovic in the final (**21%**). probability of winning the slam is **8%** adding these together give a total of **1.26** more slam for murray if nadal never became a pro. most likely he win wimbledon 2010, and possibly (but unlikely if we round down) wimbledon 2011. **without djokovic** instead of becoming a 20 time slam champion, and the most popular player on the tour, djokovic sell home remedy from his flat in belgrade. **aus open 2011:** murray face federer in the final and ha a **29%** chance of winning. **aus open 2012:** murray face ferrer in the sf (**69%**) and nadal in the final (**49%**). probability of winning the slam is **33%** **aus open 2013:** murray face ferrer in the final and ha a **61%** chance of winning. **us open 2014:** murray face kohlschreiber in the qf (**81%**), nishikori in the sf (**65%**) and cilic in the final (**63%**). probability of winning the slam is **41%** **aus open 2015:** murray face wawrinka in the final and ha a **59%** chance of winning. **french open 2015:** murray face nadal in the sf (**45%**) and wawrinka in the final (**59%**). probability of winning the slam is **26%** **aus open 2016:** federer in the final and ha a **36%** chance of winning. **french open 2016:** murray face berdych in the final and ha a 77% chance of winning. adding these together give a total of **3.63** more slam for murray if djokovic never became a pro. most likely he win au open 2013, au open 2015, french open 2016 and probably u open 2014. **without any of the big 3** i'll shorten these to avoid too much text. ao07: **4%** (wawrinka -

4540,tennis,"a majority of grand slam match novak djokovic wa expected to win and did not, he ha been either injured or coming off playing a 5 setter since 2015 (almost). an analysis of novaks loss in grand slam for most of his prime. which one surprised you guys?","\*note: excluding the time period after nole slam where nole sustained his elbow injury and wa not in form, from wimbledon 2016 - french open 2018\* we all know novak a a robot, and to me there ha rarely not been a time in a slam i did not think he wa the favorite / should have won the match going in (i will address exceptions). of all these match most of them each can be grouped into an injury he had or coming off a tough 5 setter in the previous round. here are all the matches: 2019 u open v wawrinka: retired due to injury 2015 french open v wawrinka: tough 5 setter v murray in sf (though i think novak wa probably fine here, wawrinka just played incredibly) 2020 u open: defaulted 2020 french open: 5 setter with tsitsipas in the semi 2021 u open: 5 setter with zverev in the semi finals, didn't have his leg #x200b; *this can even be stretched out to 2011 with a few more exceptions* 2013 wimbledon final v murray: coming off a brutal 5 set semi v del potro (one of the great match of the big 4 era imo) - didn't have his leg 2013 u open final: coming off a grind out 5 setter with wawrinka in the semi final (this is the one match above all others of novaks i cannot believe he lost post 2010) #x200b; **now for the exceptions:** **(note:** i do not think he should have been expected to win the 2012 wimbledon semifinal v federer, nor any french open match v nadal other than 2015) 2011 french open semi final v federer: yes, federer played great (some say it wa his best clay court match ever, but i am skeptical his best clay match ever would still lead to a very close 4 setter with djoker) but djoker had a lot of pressure having not lost up to that point in 2011, and i think his opponent withdrawing from his qf hurt him going into this match. 2012 usopen final v murray: insane wind, weird match for sure seemed like novak lost the form he had in 2011 after the 2012 australian open 2014 aoqf v wawrinka: wawrinka just played light out 2014 usosf v nishikori - probably the weirdest defeat of his prime, 2013 + 2014 were tough for him and just weird years, this being the weirdest match of his to lose 2019 french open v thiem: novak had an insane second half of 2018 til the ao2019. similar to 2012, he seemed to dip in form + mentality after the ao 2019 and the rest of 2019 wa meh for him. while he did lose this match i wa not surprised, he did not seem in usual form this year. of all the year federer played him in the wimbledon final, 2019 wa the best chance because djoker wa just off that year (and that match other than the 3 tiebreaks) #x200b; **conclusion:** yes, there are the exceptions. i will always say that 2012-14 wa just a weird time for djokovic. his 2011 style and 2015 style were actually quite different [as i alluded to here](?utm_source=shareutm_medium=web2xcontext=3) , and that period seemed to be when he stopped being able to just hit a winner out of anywhere on the court on command, but still had his world #1 confidence. when djokovic wa really in his best form (2011-ao12, 2015 - 2016fo, second half 2018 - 2019 ao, 2020-2021) he is virtually unbeatable except for nadal at the fo in form, who is actually unbeatable. if you take clay out the picture, man ha truly just been a rock for over a decade now it insane. with no other player can i truly reason out why he lost every time, federer and nadal both have match they really shoulda won but just didnt that day and i don't even have reason like i do for djokovic. i might be stretching this out a little bit, but what do you guy think of djokers loss since 2015 (or 2011).",1632199900

4635,tennis,will djokovic’s loss be good or bad for him long term?,"i can see it going both ways. good: the pressure is off. last time djokovic achieved something so historic, after his 2016 roland garros win, he fell off a cliff mentally and physically. the injury wa unfortunate but for a while after that he still played like someone who just couldn’t get 100% committed. and it would be understandable if, after the mental fortitude needed to win all four in a row, a loss of focus wa inevitable. there wa nowhere to go but down, and he went down harder than anyone anticipated. but now he has, in a sense, freed himself from that pressure. medvedev’s breakthrough take some expectation off of novak for australia - being the clear cut favourite is a lot of pressure, the underdog ha the expectation of defeat a a cushion, if they take it that away. he’s not an underdog, but there isn’t the expectation that it’s his to lose. bad: it wa an omen of what’s to come. novak looked mentally and physically drained, unable to compete in rally and maintain scoreboard pressure against a redlining and baseline controlling opponent, who escaped an early 0-40 hope in set two - something that never happens to novak, especially in a final. one of either of those to barrier to success would be one thing to overcome, but for top level athlete a physical hurdle can feed mental difficulties. losing trust in your body is super damaging. nearly five and a half year have passed since he held all four, that’s how long prime of career used to last. how long can this novak domination last? how long can his body endure? it’s entirely possible we could look back on this a a career turning point for both. interested in your thoughts, his australian open level will be fascinating to see.",1632106705

[?v=e38u3oa3s5s) * sampras v agassi 1995 u open, set point for sampras, break to take the set in a classic rally against his most important rival in tennis . [?v=1m_aeejbhaa) * agassi v baghdatis 2006 u open, no specific point just watch the match it sum up so well what agassi was, it wa an iconic match. [?v=4bsaeej9gge) * federer v djokovic 2009 u open, clean tweener to set up match point, not much to say it wa amazing, the atmosphere, the crowd going crazy, going for a u open title after winning rg and wimbledon b2b and getting sampras's g record. i love in hindsight how del potro won the next match for his only slam but at the time it felt weird watching federer lose that match after having won the semi against djokovic like that, it seemed unreal he could lose. [?v=pmj0-1ggf5k) * djokovic v federer 2011 u open, the forehand return, that match had all the fairytale story for federer in it, he wa finally going to face nadal in the final of the u open, he had not won a slam that year, he had lost with 2 mp up the year before against djokovic in the semis, 2 set up, halt his opponent's comeback in the fifth set and serf for the match, we've seen that scene too many times, whole crowd cheering for federer before a serve and him ending with an unreturned serve and the crowd going crazy, it wa obvious what wa going to happen. suddenly, i don't know what the hell through djokovic's head to come up with that forehand winner on the return and change the match, he just went on to close one of the best season in tennis history and mark the start of a decade dominated by him. [?v=_oyczslkd48) * djokovic v nadal 2013 u open, 54 shot rally for djokovic to break, it seemed he wa going to turn the match around (and he did for a while, break up in the third) but his tank wasn't that full that day, it's sad because i believe both at 100% (fitness wise) wa going to be a 5 set match of some out of this world rally with no clear winner for the match. [?v=x5eqmwvvtyu) there are much more (like in the 2011 u open final ha too many ridiculous point but i wouldn't consider them iconic because there were so many it just make it hard for one to stand out) and i have to go out, so please add yours. i'll add my bonus because roddick is my favourite player: * roddick v corretja u open 2002, iconic celebration, iconic look with the visor, crowd going crazy on match point.

4911,tennis,how many slam would each of the big 3 have if they weren't from the same era?,"obviously this doesn't factor at all into the goat debate but it's fun to think about at the very least. my thoughts: roger would have at least 30 and probably around 32, for year and year he'd only ever lose in the semi and final and it'd inevitably be to either novak or rafa. especially at the french, he'd have a much healthier trophy count. possibly his only significant loss that didn't come to these two wa to del potro at us'09. rafa would have around 27. while he'd have a maximum of 2 more rg, he's often fallen just a bit short of the other two in other finals, specifically at ao. but the fact that's he's a lot more shaky against the rest of the tour in the early round (especially at wimbledon) mean he probably wouldn't have much more than 27. novak would probably only have a maximum of 25. especially in recent years, he's converted almost every single opportunity in major against the other two. his loss at the biggest stage have often been to player from outside the big 3 (murray, wawrinka, medvedev etc.)",1631780452

4996,tennis,"novak had in mind to finish his career, had he won the u open.","i know that this will probably sound far-fetched, but bear with me. i wa thinking about the way sunday’s final played out, and i'm convinced that novak had in mind to finish his career, had he won the u open. several clue point to that: **the on-court interview.** after beating zverev in the semifinal, he said that he will play the final match like it wa the last of his career. quote: ""there is only one more match. all in, all in. let's do it! i'm going to treat that match like it's the last match of my career."" at that time i thought, a everybody else did, that it wa just a figure of speech. a bold statement, of a kind he like to give. but, i ask you to read the quote again, after reading the rest of this text. **the final post-match press conference**, the part where he spoke to the serbian journalists. quote: ""well you need to keep on getting better. otherwise, stagnation, regression. without training hard in all aspects, both on the court and outside of the court, you cannot have the results. and of course, the more time passes, for u older guys, it's getting harder. it's getting 2x harder for u than for the younger ones, to stay on the top, to be candidate for winning slams. i am definitely aware of that, but it's not something that worry me, it's a natural cycle of life. but i don't feel old and worn out, in my body. of course, now, life is also much different. i am also a husband, a father. when i look at my life a a whole, i have other priorities. i'd like to spend more time with my kids, i promised that to myself, because... being away from them hurts. a lot. i'm sorry."" then, he started to cry, and left the press room in tears. when you think about what he said, it seems that he is tired, not physically, but tired emotionally, tired of scarifying family time, family life, for his tennis. tennis is the only life he ha known, since he wa a child. disciplined and devoted a he is, all these year he wa ready to work and work harder, but at the price of not having the time for other stuff in his life. it's obvious that it is becoming increasingly hard for him, especially since he became a family man. it's not just the travel and being physically away from his family. it is also the hour he put into training, each and every day. even when he is close to them, he cannot spend enough time with them. he said he promised to himself that he would change that. and, i think, at some point during this year, this epic slam run, an idea wa born. to end it all while he's at the very top. if he wa to win the uso, he would quit. with that win he would have achieved the cygs, his record 21st major, and his record 7th year-end number one. those achievement would cement his position a the goat. and he would be free. free from grueling everyday training and preparations. free to live another life. free to be with his kid a much a he wanted. **the tears.** the way novak cried before medvedev's last service game that ended the set, and the match, wa unprecedented. the scene wa truly shocking. he looked to be in agony, in despair. and, i believe, that he wa not cry over losing the uso. he had won so many slams, and had some tough loses too. and the cygs, i don’t think he cried because of that, either. he already had won all four in a row. he had that achievement no other male player of his, and many previous generation could get to. those were not tear of loss. those were the tear of separation. from his family, from his children. from a new life he had imagined for himself. that wa the moment that he realized that the chase is not over. that the grind wa not over. that the sacrifice wa not over. yes, i know, all of this sound far-fetched. but, i think it's possible that, sometimes into the future, maybe in an interview or a biography, we will learn that there wa some kind of plan to end it all there and then. but, life is tough, even for the most successful people, and life laugh at our plans. i'm sure that novak will swallow this hard pill and will bounce back. he is a seasoned player gifted with exceptional resilience. now, read the on-court interview quote again.",1631715655
