Now they are using some private photos which is some kinda chat history to another person instead of directly to the public(which also the same way as the first letter),idk why Peng can't post it by her own account.

everyone even those terrorists (like the Chinese new friend) knows that the best way to prove that thing is not ture is let Peng make a short video like' I'm ok ' then post it everywhere,but Chinese government didn't do that,so I'm afraid there is already something bad happened",1637383570

I think thats true for every subject in life.I think we are conformist society and we are always inclined to join herd than to step out of the herd and say"" people this is not right, this is not true"".i will raise my voice and fight for others that were less fotunate than i was, but a lot of people pick easier way out. They choose to only worry about themselves and not about others and because our sport is individual its more pronounced with us.But okay, it doesnt bother me, i know who i am and whats right and i am ready to fight for that. I know i am thorn in the eye of many, because i try to expose monopol in tennis.Almost nobody talks about it.Sports media and tennis media dont talk about how many palyers can make living of playing tennis. They all talk about how much do Federer,Nadal and Djokovic earn,but they dont talk about tennis being 3rd most poupular sport in world while also being outside top 10 when it comes to earnings. Barely 150-200 players can make living in womans and mens tennis.Give 150th best player in any other popular sport and tell me how much they earn?PTPA exists for those girls and boys that are giving their best for their voice to be heard, but unfortunately they dont listen to them.Elite will alawys have elites back,forever, becuse of that their is some small boy from Serbia to intervene

Reporter: ""We have talked about your thoughts about the sport off the court, and I want to know, why do you think that people won't listen to what you (and the PTPA) are saying?""

Novak: ""Well, we don't have the whole night to talk about this topic. When it comes to tennis or life in general, we are comfortable beings, we don't want change or interruption to the status quo. Most people unfortunately don't want to raise their voices for others who are less privileged or fortunate than they are. They choose the easier path, the one that has less obstacles. The big problem is, that we are in an individual sport so these selfish choices have more weight. 


I don't find it very bad though, because I for myself know who I am and what I want to fight for. It's not the first time and it won't be the last time. For a lot of people I am a thorn in their side, because I myself am trying to take apart the monopoly that is ruling the financial side of the sport. 


You see all media, they don't talk about how many professional tennis players make a good living from playing the sport. They talk about how much Djokovic, Nadal or Federer are earning but they don't even mention that tennis is the world's 3rd most popular sport yet is only top 10 in the amount of prize money the players get. Max. 200 players from the men and women side are actually making a living.


Now that is the whole reason for the PTPA, we want to make the men and women' voices who are not in the top 200 of the world heard. For now unfortunately we are not heard, and the elite is going to continue on doing what elites do: their thing.

That is the reason why we are trying to help out.",1637359402

**Q: What is the best advice that you have received from the Big 3?**

Rune:  Djokovic asked me the first time I practiced with him (I think I was 14  years old and I was a hitting partner for him in Monaco) if I liked the  way I played tennis. And I said yes. And he said good, that‚Äôs important. 

At that time I thought it was a little strange but later I have thought about it and it is very important to like your  tennis. Not only playing tactically or playing what your coach tells you  works best, but also playing your own tennis. The tennis that makes ME happy. 

Djokovic has told me many good things. It's funny because it's always Federer and Nadal that are mentioned as the good guys but in  terms of the future generations, I think Djokovic is the most giving. I  haven‚Äôt heard Federer or Nadal giving too much advice to the young  players, maybe they do to the youngsters from their countries. But  according to me, Djokovic is the most giving.",1637357830

In 2018, there were 15 women's singles and 14 men's singles matches with this type of scoreline, a substantial difference for the women's from 2019 (where 32 matches had this scoreline). Out of the 14 men's singles matches, only 4 happened at Slams (one at each Slam, in fact). 

Fun facts:

\- The players who were on both ends of this scoreline include Svitolina and Fabbiano.

54,tennis,Some misunderstanding about Peng Shuai topic,"1, Some people claim they are lovers so it is just a domestic martial issue.

Not really. In fact, Peng Shuai topic is completely censored in Chinese Internet, and No one is allowed to talk about it publicly. CCP posts Peng's email overseas, but has said nothing about it to Chinese people. Also, most importantly, Peng Shuai herself, disappears completely. Even if they are true lovers, Peng Shuai should have the right to speak publicly, rather being silenced and being ""disappeared"". 

Also, it is truly love? Zhang is one of the seven most powerful men in China, and his behavior is not restricted by law. It means, he can rape any girl any time free of punishment. Can Peng Shuai says No when such a man rapes her? Also, from Peng Shuai's Weibo we know Zhang's wife acts as a guard in the front door when his husband is raping, so definitely it is not  an extramarital affair.

2, Some people claim that it is just CCP's internal struggle and Peng Shuai is just a tool.

It is possible, but firstly the possibility is low because sleeping with famous women is very common in CCP and no one used it as an excuse before. Second and most importantly, even if it is true, it also reveals how weak women is faced with those powerful men. Peng Shuai is definitely a victim even if Xi uses her as a weapon, so it is still meaningful to support her.",1637334174

96,tennis,Novak Djokovic comment on Bob Green interview ( one of the founders of ATP )," With ATP I think we have somewhere between 25-30% as average of what players get from the tournaments. That's for ATP. When it comes to Grand Slams, the average is half of that, maybe around 11-12%, if nothing changed in the last 2 years.Some change did happen, in terms of absolute prize money numbers (not really in the last 2 years because of covid), it does go in the direction of increase, but... The media keeps on writing about how the players get more prize money, but they don't write about how much the revenue has increased for the tournaments. In percentages, that increase is much much higher than what was passed to the players.

It's really a touchy subject in our sport. I was never reluctant to talk about it, I think it's very important. I know that it's uncomfortable subject for many tournaments, people in the politics and business of tennis, those who do not want certain information to be made public for the players to find out about how the business is organized.

That's really the biggest reason why PTPA is founded, why such an organization needs to exist. We don't have any other 100% player body to represent them and their rights. No matter how much I do respect ATP, they have their good sides without a doubt, but the system does not work, we've seen that many times in the past. I was in the council for nearly 10 years, so I really know how much we have tried, but it simply doesn't work.

For the players to be able to really make a bigger change for their lives and bigger step forward, it really needs to be done through an organization that is solely focused on representing the players. Otherwise, we are just running in circles.

Unfortunately, the players have their priorities in training and excelling at tennis, and the other side (tournaments and tennis politicians) have their priorities in these things (earnings) - so there is already a huge gap (for any negotiations). Many things are being done that are not in the players interest.

I hope that those who are not in PTPA today will start to recognize this problem. There are many top players who still haven't joined. I'm sorry about that, but I can understand that everyone needs time to think about it, maybe they'll support it, maybe not. The more time passes, there is less time to make some concrete change, because in the meantime new rules are being passed.

For example, the new 30-year period contract, the 30 year licence extension for all the Masters, that's really crazy. That's not being done in any other sport - to give a 30 year guarantee to anyone, it's unbelievable. And then f.e. from those licences, that will go double in price because of the extra days of tournament organization, they sell the licences for hundreds of millions of euros, and the players get nothing. And we (the players), as part of ATP, have enabled all of that - longer tournaments, 30year licences, but we don't get anything from selling those rights.

That's just one example, and there are lots of similar red flags for the players in that new deal. Only if the big majority of the players gets together, especially the top players, we can make some actual change. If we continue like we are doing now, we are just running in circles, and that works for the benefits of those who have the monopoly.",1637282382

\*not a true bagel but still included

In total, there were 32 women's singles matches and 13 men's singles matches (12 if you exclude the Next Gen Finals) in 2019 with this scoreline. Comparing to 21 and 16 matches respectively in 2021, that's a substantial increase on the women's side and a slight decrease in the men's.

Fun facts:

\- Sasnovich won by this type of scoreline 4 times in 2019, 3 of those being a first set bagel. Talk about a slow starter. 

\- For the first half of the year (up to Wimbledon), almost every tournament week in the WTA had a match with this scoreline. The only ones that didn't were the two weeks of the Australian Open, Fed Cup Quarterfinals, Mexican Open, Fed Cup Semifinals, the week of the Prague and Morocco Open, Italian Open, the week of the Birmingham Classic and the Mallorca Open, and Eastbourne International. This also means that during that first half, there were only two weeks where multiple tournaments were held in the same week and this scoreline didn't happen. 

\-  So far in my posts regarding this type of scoreline (covering 2019-2021), the 2019 Rosmalen Championships (WTA) is the only tournament where this scoreline happened in a final. In a similar vein, the Tianjin Open is the only tournament I've covered so far where this scoreline happened in the semis (unless you include the Next Gen Finals).

\- Players who have been on both ends of this scoreline in 2019 include Blinkova, Mladenovic, Bertens, Petkovic, Strycova, Lajovic, and Cecchinato.

\- Except for the Qatar Open, Hungarian Open and Hall of Fame Open, all scorelines of this type in the ATP occurred in 'big' tournaments (Slams, Masters, and Next Gen Finals).

\- Winners who received and dished out a bagel in the same match include Ostapenko, Kanepi, Strycova, and Bublik.",1637280060

1,tennis,Daniil Medvedev wins thriller match against Jannik Sinner in Turin," **The 5th day at the** [**ATP**](https://tennisuptodate.com/atp) **Finals finished off with a bang of a match between Medvedev and Sinner that the Russian ultimately won after three sets.**

**Medvedev did not need this win as he was already in the semifinals yet the Russian will finish off the group stage undefeated. His last match was against Sinner who technically could have fought for the semifinals if Zverev lost today but that did not happen. The start of the match showcased all of the good sides of Medvedev.**

**Sinner entered the match quite nervous and committed a lot of mistakes and it showed on the score sheet. It was 6-0 for Medvedev and it seemed like the Russian would cruise in this match. That was not the case as Sinner started playing much better in the 2nd set. The Italian crowd got into the match as well and Sinner was able to go up a break.**

**Medvedev pulled it right back and the match continued with high intensity. Ultimately we ended up in the tiebreak where Medvedev looked to end it. He was close but a few sharp points by SInner pulled him in front and ultimately won him the tiebreak with 7-5. The 3rd set featured strong play by both at the start with no chances on return.**

**Sinner pulled ahead first breaking Medvedev and taking the 4-2 lead. He almost took a 5-2 lead after Medvedev started playing quite aggressively. In the end, Medvedev held his serve and pulled the break back. The match continued into the tiebreak where both players had match points. Ultimately it was Medvedev who pulled through with 10-8.**",1637276050

But if it doesn't count as a full match, would Sinner still be credited with the win? If so, Medvedev and Sinner would both have a 2-0 record. Zverev would win the group, and Sinner would come in second.

Or would Karatsev have the opportunity to step in and play a match against Sinner as the alternate?

There is no country in the world to say China what they are supposed to do and even if someone dares to do that, China wouldn't care a bit. They will still do whatever they want, especially for internal situations.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't post it but just being realistic. To be honest, I also don't know why I'm posting this, but when I see people very passionate asking others to make their profile pics something about Peng Shuai, I feel like ""what's the point?"".

Aside from a QF appearance at Indian Wells, she's hasn't done much at Premier/1000/Slam level this year.

Her best slam performance to date is a QF at the Australian Open back in 2020, peppered with a few 4Rs over the past 6 years.

She's recently starting working with Dmitry Tursunov and that relationship has seemingly helped improve her form over the last 3 months.  I've heard some say she's now ready to take that next step at some big tournaments in 2022 and do some damage, but was this just a purple patch this autumn, or is this upturn in Kontaveit's form here to stay?

66,tennis,WTA Appreciation Post,"As the WTA Finals conclude, I'd like to take a moment and appreciate how well the WTA is run and how much more exciting it is becoming day by day. 

For starters, their decision to move the tournament to Mexico was at first criticized. People talked about the altitude, the balls, the fact that it was an outdoor tournament etc. However, it was a resounding success with incredible crowd support, great matches and memorable stories. I'm sure they will seriously consider increasing the number of tournaments in LATAM.

As I've written in another post, the tour is often criticized for lack of dominance and consistency, sometimes rightly so. However, you can see how important depth is by comparing the WTA and ATP finals so far. With Rafa and Roger out, the tournament has been very forgettable so far. Sure, the withdrawals of Tsitsipas and Berrettini made it worse, but without disrespecting the other players, I doubt that Ruud vs Norrie is what people expect at the most exclusive tournament of the season. On the other hand, the WTA Finals were full of exciting matches, a large number of players that are evenly matched and that's why there were many surprises. 

Lastly and most importantly I want to acknowledge the spine that Simon and the tour have shown in the horrid Peng Shuai situation. Of course no one should realistically expect that a tennis organization will seriously influence the Chinese government. Taking tournaments away from China will impact the WTA much more than the government of China, but that's exactly the point. They are taking a stance to protect their player and they didn't cave after the dubious announcement. Overall the tour is doing a great job and it's clearly evident.",1637221390

In 2020, there were 8 women's singles matches and 9 men's singles matches with this type of scoreline, far less than 21 women's and 16 men's from 2021 (although this is to be expected, considering how 2020 affected tournaments). Interesting to note is that there are actually more men's singles matches with this scoreline than women's. However, as someone commented on my 2021 post, the bo5 nature of men's Slam matches means more sets to potentially get bageled in, and as you can see, 5/9 of these matches are from Slams. 2019 is up next!",1637212986

79,tennis,Mixed feelings,,1637209329
80,tennis,"Interesting fact: Not a single member of the ""Big 3"" ever won the ""ATP Finals"" in its current form/name/branding","The ""ATP Tour finals"" changed multiple forms and brendings since its inception in 1970.

It's very first edition for example, was callled the ""Masters Grand Prix"" (Pepsi-Cola Masters for sponsorship purposes) and it featured six players, each competing against each other in a ""Round Robin"" format where the one with most wins after 5  games was crowdned the champion (Stan Smith won it with 4-1 record, just like Rod Laver. However Stan Smith defeated Rod Laver in the h2h match)

The formats changed soon after, but the official ""Name""/""Branding"" for the final ATP tournament stayed the same - **Masters Grand Prix**

This was the case until 1990 when it changed the name to **ATP Tour World Championships**

The start of the 2000s meant a new change for the final tournament on the ATP tour. Starting with the year 2000, this tournament was known as **Tennis Masters Cup**

This was the case until 2009 where it was renamed to **ATP World Tour Finals**. 

Interestingly, the 2009 tournament had THE BIG 4! Murray, Federer, Djokovic and Murray! All 4 split in 2 different groups. 
Nadal and Djokovic were together in one group....and...BOTH WERE ELIMINATED! Soderling and Davydenko advanced from that group! 

From the other group...MURRAY WAS ELIMINATED IN THE GROUP! Only Federer advanced to the semis.....and he lost to Davydenko! 

The reason why I am saying this is that.... from 2006 to the start of the new ""branding"" of the tournament every single winner was one of the ""Big 4"" other than....Davydenko, in 2009.

2006, 2007, 2010, 2011 were the years when Federer won the tournament. 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 were the years when Djokovic won the title, and in 2016 - Andy Murray won it.

But let's move on. After the ""ATP World Tour Finals"" - it was time for another rebranding.

In 2017, the ATP did another rebranding.

This time, the tournament was only known as.... **ATP Finals**

Simple name, but the results were anything but simple!

Since then, the 2021 edition will be the 5th editon of ""ATP Finals"", but in the previous 4... not a single member of the big 3 managed to win it!

Here's what happened:

**2017**:

Nadal and Federer were the only ones representing ""THE GOATS""

Nadal played only one match and lost before withdrawing due to injury.

Federer defeated Sock  (2-0), Cilic (2-1) and Zverev (2-1) to advance to the semis with the perfect score of 3-0!

However, in the semi-finals he was stunned! He lost 2-1 in sets to Goffin, after winning the first set 6-2. He lost the next two 3-6;4-6.

Dimitrov defeated  Goffin in the finals to become the first champion of ""ATP Finals""

**2018:**

Another year with one of the ""Big 3"" missing. This time it was Nadal not  being part of the tournament.

Djokovic started the group stage with 3 wins and not a single lost set! He defeated Cilic, Isner and Zverev 2-0!

Federer won two matches and lost one in the group stage.

Federer defeated Thiem and Anderson 2-0, and lost 2-1 to Nishikori.

Novak and Federer avoided each other in the semis since both won their groups.

Novak Djokovic defeated Anderson 6-2;6-2.

Federer lost 5-7;6-7 to Zverev, thus robbing us of the third final between the two at the ""ATP's final tournament of the year"" (for the record, they played in the finals at 2015 and 2012 with Novak winning 2-0, and Roger withdrew before the 2014 finals)

In the finals of the 2018 edition of the ATP Finals... Novak lost! Zverev won 6-4;6-3! 

**2019:**

Finally, the gang's all here!

The best chance that the ""Big 3"" had at winning the ATP Finals!

Nadal had the luck(?) of avoiding Novak and Roger in the group stage...

...but I am not sure if that's luck as he was eliminated in the group stage.

Despite..winning two matches!

Nadal defeated Tsitsipas and Medvedev (both 2-1) and lost 2-0 to Zverev. The won-lost sets were not in his favour so he failed to qualify for the semis.

In the other group... Djokovic was eliminated!

Novak defeated Berretini (2-0), lost to Thiem (1-2) and... lost to Roger! (0-2)

Other than the win vs Novak, Federer also defeated Berretini (2-0) and lost to Thiem (0-2)

In the semis - Federer lost to Tsitsipas 2-0!

In the eventual final, Tsitsipas defeated Thiem 2-1.

**2020:**

We are back to one of them missing.

This time Federer was the only one who was not there.

Novak lost to Medvedev (0-2) but wins against Zverev (2-0) and Schwartzman (2-0) helped him qualify for the semis.

In the other group, Nadal lost 0-2 (6‚Äì7^(7‚Äì9), 6‚Äì7^(4‚Äì7)) to Thiem but he defeated Tsitsipas 2-1 and Rublev 2-0.

Both Nadal and Djokovic finished second in their group.

They avoided each other in the semis and the scene was set.

Novak. Rafa.

One win away from the great finals.

Aaand.... Medvedev defeated Nadal 2-1 and Thiem defeated Novak 2-1...

In the eventual final, Medvedev defeated Thiem 2-1.

2021, marks the first year since the rebraning of ""ATP Finals"" where there's only one member of the ""Big 3"" present at it - Novak Djokovic.

We'll see if he'll manage to win it or if we'll see another big upset.",1637207841

4,tennis,Quick WTA Finals Doubles Preview and Barbora Krejcikova Appreciation post,"This match-up, Krejcikova-Siniakova vs. Hsieh-Mertens may seem like a no-brainer since K-S already won this match-up easily in Round Robin play. 

However, a a big final is different, and 3 of these 4 players were involved in the AO final this year, where Mertens and Sabalenka beat K-S in straight sets.

Siniakova was so tight she was often reduced to tears, and an interesting phenomenon when she is feeling the pressure, is that Krejcikova tries to do more than she usually does, and makes more errors. 

Mertens also was so tight she could hardly keep the ball in play, and then you had Sabalenka, who had suffered a gut-wrenching, the-match-was-on-her-racquet 4th round loss to Serena, was running around the court, laughing and as loose as could be - this doubles final was just fun for her (and after the match, she ended her partnership with Mertens and has cut back on doubles).

So, in this match, Hsieh may be that wildcard free spirit, able to dance around the court while everyone else is feeling the presssure. No question Hsieh is a doubles genius but she does not have the big game of Sabalenka to just start hitting winners all over from the baseline as Sabalenka did relentlessly in the AO final.

Hsieh may be the best doubles player in the world now that Ash Barty hardly plays, but Krejcikova is not very far behind. 

As far as i can tell, in about 20 doubles service games this tournament, Krejcikova has been broken ONE TIME. That is an almost unbelevable statistic for women's doubles, where service breaks happen much more frequently than men's doubles. It's a testament to Krejcikova's versatile serving and outstanding forehand that she can so dominate on serve in doubles.

Many will point to her 0-3 record in singles this tournament as a sign that Krejcikova is not here to stay in singles, but I would not be so ready to dismiss her. I think she has really focussed more on her doubles this tournament, and it shows. 

Obviously it takes two to win a doubles championship, but everyone should remember that WHEN Krejcikova and Siniakova lift that trophy today, it will be a triumph for Krejcikova and a testament to one of the best doubles players women's tennis has ever seen.",1637182053

48,tennis,Maybe Unpopular Opinion - This ATP Finals is a Mess,"I know many of you won‚Äôt agree, but this had easily been the worst ATP finals since I started watching tennis back in 2001. The matches are boring (except for Meddy/Zverev), that groups were completely unbalanced from the start, and the retirements have made things even worse. 

Tsitsipas looked awful against Rublev because of how bad he felt physically, then Djokovic who didn‚Äôt even have to give 90% effort rolls Rublev in the most boring match of the year. 

Idk‚Ä¶everything just lacks the usual energy. Maybe the semifinals will get better but the RR has been rough",1637159309
49,tennis,Djokovic crashes an interview.,,1637159216
50,tennis,The biggest implication of 40-15 is yet to come,"If Djokovic ends up having a 3+ GS lead over Federer then 40-15 would effectively have no impact on the GOAT outcome at least as far as Federer is concerned. I think it is quite likely that Djokovic will in fact win at least 3 more GS in his career with Federer not adding anything more.

So even if Federer had won Wimbledon 2019 he was still not really assured of being GOAT. However what he would have guaranteed himself was to be the grass GOAT decisively. There was simply zero chance Djokovic would ever get to 9 Wimbledon titles if he lost in 2019. 

However now I would say he is quite likely to end up with 8 Wimbledon titles which is all he needs to do to become the grass GOAT. If he can win in 2022 which he is the clear favourite for then you bet Djokovic would have grass GOAThood in his sights. We know he will give his everything to achieve it given how much he is motivated by history.

And that in my opinion would be the biggest blow to Federer's legacy to not be the best at any surface.",1637159044

82,tennis,New Interview with Federer (Swiss Media),"for English below

&amp;#x200B;

**Die  Tenniswelt spekuliert, wann Sie zur√ºckkehren, ob man Sie bereits am  Australian Open wieder sieht. Was ist der Stand der Dinge?**

Die  Wahrheit ist, dass ich unglaublich √ºberrascht w√§re, wenn ich in  Wimbledon (ab dem 27. Juli 2022) schon wieder spielen w√ºrde. Australien  kommt √ºberhaupt nicht infrage. Das ist aber auch keine √úberraschung f√ºr  mich. Bereits vor der Operation wussten wir, dass danach eine  monatelange Pause n√∂tig w√ºrde. Ich wollte den ersten grossen Check-up  der √Ñrzte abwarten, bevor ich mich √∂ffentlich √§ussere, und der war nun  sehr ermutigend. Ich habe einen l√§ngeren Rehabilitationsprozess  begonnen, in den ich mein ganzes Herzblut stecke. Es ist nun einmal so,  dass die Situation nicht mit der von 2016 zu vergleichen ist. Ich muss  geduldig sein, meinem Knie Zeit geben, damit es sich zu 100 Prozent  erholen kann.

 

**In  der kollektiven Vorstellung ist ein Meniskus schnell geheilt. Man  erinnert sich an Pirmin Zurbriggen, den italienischen Fussballer Franco  Baresi oder Ihr linkes Knie. Warum dauert es diesmal rechts so lange?**

Die  Untersuchungen nach der Rasensaison ergaben, dass mein rechter  Innenmeniskus erneut verletzt war. Er musste gen√§ht werden, was eine  gewisse Zeit der Ruhigstellung bedingte. Und die √Ñrzte nutzten die  Gelegenheit, um auch meinen Knorpel zu behandeln. Die Kombination dieser  beiden Eingriffe erfordert Geduld und Vorsicht. Deshalb konnte ich mein  Bein nicht belasten, als ich an Kr√ºcken ging. Ich h√§tte diese Operation  auf jeden Fall durchf√ºhren m√ºssen, um mein langfristiges Wohlergehen zu  sichern. Es handelt sich um einen wiederherstellenden Eingriff. In  diesem Sinne ist er wichtiger als die Operationen im Jahr 2020  (ebenfalls am rechten Knie), die prim√§r darauf abzielten, meine  Beschwerden zu lindern, die ich seit einigen Jahren mit mir  herumgeschleppt hatte.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sind  die unterschiedlichen Auswirkungen auf Ihr rechtes und Ihr linkes Knie  auf die unterschiedliche Belastung bei den Grundschl√§gen zur√ºckzuf√ºhren?**

Das  ist meine Vermutung, aber man kann es nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die  Tatsache, dass ich die Vorhand aus dem offenen Stand und die R√ºckhand  aus dem geschlossenen Stand schlage, wobei die Hauptlast auf dem rechten  Knie liegt, hat sicherlich eine Rolle gespielt. Ich hatte eigentlich  immer das Gef√ºhl, dass mein rechtes Knie koordinativ besser ist. Ich  sp√ºrte es in den √úbungen mit Pierre (Paganini, seinem Fitnesstrainer),  es h√§lt mehr aus. Es ist das reaktionsschnellere der beiden Knie. Ich  spiele ja auch mit dem rechten Fuss Fussball. Zweifellos hat die  zus√§tzliche Belastung dazu gef√ºhrt, dass das rechte Knie auf Dauer mehr  gelitten hat.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wie sieht Ihr Zeitplan f√ºr Ihre R√ºckkehr auf die Tour aus?**

Die  √Ñrzte sagen, dass ich im Januar wieder leicht joggen und allm√§hlich auf  den Court zur√ºckkehren kann. Sanft. (lacht) Sie wissen es nicht, aber  ich habe schon ein bisschen Tennis mit den Kindern gespielt‚Ä¶ Im M√§rz  oder April kann ich dann wieder mit einem tennis√§hnlichen Training  beginnen, mit Ausfallschritten und komplexeren Bewegungen. Und nat√ºrlich  muss ich die gesamte Kondition wieder aufbauen, die f√ºr Tennis auf sehr  hohem Niveau notwendig ist. Derzeit rechne ich damit, dass ich im  Sommer 2022 zur√ºckkehren kann. Die n√§chsten vier oder f√ºnf Monate sind  entscheidend. Im Fr√ºhling werde ich schon viel klarer sehen.

 

**Mit welchen Ambitionen m√∂chten Sie im Sommer auf die Tour zur√ºckkehren?**

Bevor  ich darauf antworte, m√∂chte ich sagen, dass ich diese Operation machen  liess, um in den kommenden Jahren und Jahrzehnten mit meinen Kindern  Skifahren oder mit meinen Freunden Fussball oder Tennis spielen zu  k√∂nnen. Meine prim√§re Motivation war es, mich f√ºr mein normales Leben  wieder in Form zu bringen. Aber ich wollte diese anspruchsvolle  Rehabilitation mit der Mentalit√§t und dem K√∂rper eines Spitzensportlers  angehen. W√§re das zwei, drei Jahre nach meinem R√ºcktritt auch noch  m√∂glich? Ich weiss es nicht. Was meine sportlichen Ambitionen angeht,  k√∂nnte man die so zusammenfassen: Ich m√∂chte noch einmal sehen, was ich  als Tennisprofi leisten kann. Ich k√§mpfe daf√ºr und bin sehr motiviert.  Ich sp√ºre die Unterst√ºtzung meines Teams und meiner Familie. Wir alle  w√ºnschen uns, dass ich mich auf meine Weise und auf einem Tenniscourt  verabschieden kann.

 

**Steht f√ºr Sie der Abschied auf dem Court im Vordergrund?**

Ja,  und wenn man es genau nimmt, macht es keinen grossen Unterschied, ob  ich 2022 oder erst 2023 zur√ºckkehre, mit 40 oder 41 Jahren. Das ist  egal. Die Frage ist vielmehr: Werde ich es schaffen, mich f√ºr mein  Comeback nochmals Tag f√ºr Tag zu qu√§len? Mein Herz sagt heute ja. Also  gehe ich die Dinge Schritt f√ºr Schritt an. Ich habe √§hnliche  Herausforderungen in meiner Karriere schon oft erlebt. Manchmal ohne  dass es der √ñffentlichkeit bewusst war. Und obschon ich weiss, dass das  Ende nah ist, m√∂chte ich versuchen, nochmals ein paar grosse Spiele zu  bestreiten. Es wird nicht leicht sein, aber ich werde es probieren.

 

**Man  k√∂nnte Ihre Fans in zwei Kategorien einteilen: in jene, die nicht  hinschauen k√∂nnen, einen Roger Federer zu sehen, der keine grossen Titel  mehr gewinnt. Und in jene, die einfach froh sind, wenn Sie wieder  spielen. Verstehen Sie diesen Gegensatz?**

(er  √ºberlegt) Ich bin ja auch ein grosser Sportfan und finde, dass das  jeder Athlet f√ºr sich selbst entscheiden soll. Es gibt nicht den  richtigen Zeitpunkt, um abzutreten. Sondern nur den Zeitpunkt, der f√ºr  jeden einzelnen Sportler passt. Es ist eine sehr pers√∂nliche  Entscheidung. Was f√ºr ein Bild werden die Leute von mir in Erinnerung  behalten? Meinen letzten Satz in Wimbledon im vergangenen Juli? Oder  meine Grand-Slam-Titel und was es bei ihnen ausl√∂ste, als sie mir beim  Spielen zugesehen haben? Ich tippe auf Zweiteres. Seit einigen Jahren  bin ich in dieser Hinsicht ziemlich entspannt. Aber ich verstehe die  Gef√ºhle der Fans. Und ihretwegen habe ich Sie angerufen, um offen zu  reden. Meine Fans haben es verdient, meine Gef√ºhle und Hoffnungen zu  verstehen. Es w√§re f√ºr mich einfach, zu sagen: ¬´Es ist okay, ich habe  viel gegeben und viel erhalten. H√∂ren wir hier auf.¬ª Aber dass ich alles  investiere, um nochmals zur√ºckzukommen, ist auch meine Art, mich bei  meinen Fans zu bedanken. Sie haben Besseres verdient als das Bild, das  meine letzte Rasensaison hinterlassen hat.

 

**Apropos  Rasen: Trotz Ihres Meniskusrisses erreichten Sie den Viertelfinal in  Wimbledon. Ist das in Ihrer Situation nicht ein ermutigendes Zeichen?**

Ich  sp√ºrte schon in Halle gegen Felix Auger-Aliassime, dass mein Wimbledon  nicht das sein w√ºrde, was ich mir erhofft hatte. Auch wenn ich die Art  meiner Verletzung noch nicht kannte, wusste ich, dass ich eingeschr√§nkt  sein w√ºrde. Aber wenn du alles auf ein Turnier ausrichtest ‚Äì so wie  wahrscheinlich auch Rafa (Nadal) in Roland Garros ‚Äì, ist es normal, die  Probleme beiseitezuschieben und alles zu geben. Ausserdem hoffst du  immer auf ein Wunder. Es gibt immer eine kleine Chance‚Ä¶ Was w√§re  passiert, wenn ich das Tiebreak des zweiten Satzes gegen Hurkacz  gewonnen h√§tte? Wenn du angeschlagen bist, klammerst du dich an alles:  an deine fr√ºheren Siege, deine Erfahrung auf Rasen. Im Nachhinein  stellte ich fest, dass ich in Wimbledon fast keinen Punkt gewonnen  hatte, wenn ich mich hatte verteidigen m√ºssen. Aber ja, dieses Wimbledon  best√§tigte mir, dass ich trotz meiner Einschr√§nkung immer noch auf  hohem Niveau spielen konnte. Und wenn man bedenkt, wie weit ich kam, da  muss ich es einfach nochmals versuchen.

 

**Sie  sagten eingangs, dass Sie nicht glauben, dass Sie 2022 in Wimbledon  antreten werden. Wird man Sie an Grand Slams nochmals brillieren sehen?**

Wenn  ich meine Rehabilitation intensiv betreibe, dann besteht die Chance,  dass ich nochmals auf ein hohes Niveau zur√ºckkomme. Wenn ich  Krafttraining mache, aufs Velo gehe, schwimme, Gleichgewichts√ºbungen  mache, an meinem Oberk√∂rper arbeite, dann glaube ich daran. Ob ich f√ºr  eine kleinere Runde auf die Tour zur√ºckkehre oder f√ºr etwas Gr√∂sseres?  Niemand weiss das, weder die √Ñrzte noch ich. Aber ich k√§mpfe daf√ºr. Um  es klar zu sagen: Meine Welt wird nicht zusammenbrechen, wenn ich nie  wieder einen Grand-Slam-Final bestreite. Aber es ist mein ultimativer  Traum, nochmals zur√ºckzukehren. Und tats√§chlich glaube ich immer noch  daran. Ich glaube an diese Art von Wunder. Ich habe sie schon erlebt.  Die Sportgeschichte schreibt manchmal solche Wunder. Ich bin  realistisch: Es w√§re ein grosses Wunder. Aber im Sport gibt es Wunder.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Translation**

**The tennis world is speculating when you will return, whether you will already be seen at the Australian Open. What is the state of play?**

The truth is that I would be incredibly surprised if I were to play again at Wimbledon (from July 27, 2022). Australia is out of the question at all. But that's not a surprise for me either. Even before the operation, we knew that a month-long break would be necessary afterwards. I wanted to wait for the first major check-up by the doctors before I made a public statement, and that was very encouraging. I have started a longer rehabilitation process in which I put all my heart and soul. The fact is that the situation cannot be compared to 2016. I have to be patient, give my knee time to recover 100 percent.

 

**In the collective mind, a meniscus heals quickly. People remember Pirmin Zurbriggen, the Italian footballer Franco Baresi, or your left knee. Why is it taking so long on the right this time?**

The examinations after the grass season revealed that my right medial meniscus was injured again. It had to be stitched, which required a period of immobilization. And the doctors took the opportunity to treat my cartilage as well. The combination of these two procedures requires patience and caution. That's why I couldn't put any weight on my leg when I was on crutches. I definitely should have had this surgery to ensure my long-term well-being. It is a restorative surgery. In that sense, it is more important than the surgeries I had in 2020 (also on my right knee), which were primarily aimed at relieving discomfort I had been carrying around for several years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Are the different effects on your right and left knees due to the different loading on the groundstrokes?**

That's my guess, but it's impossible to say for sure. The fact that I hit the forehand from an open stance and the backhand from a closed stance, with the main load on the right knee, certainly played a role. I actually always felt that my right knee was better coordination-wise. I felt it in the exercises with Pierre (Paganini, his fitness trainer), it holds up more. It's the more responsive of the two knees. I also play soccer with my right foot. There's no doubt that the extra strain has meant that the right knee has suffered more in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is your timetable for your return to the Tour?**

The doctors say I'll be able to jog lightly again in January and gradually return to the court. Gently. (laughs) They don't know it, but I've already been playing a little tennis with the kids... Then in March or April I can start training again in a tennis-like way, with lunges and more complex movements. And of course, I need to rebuild all the conditioning that is necessary for tennis at a very high level. Currently, I expect to be able to return in the summer of 2022. The next four or five months are crucial. In the spring, I will already see things much more clearly.

 

**With what ambitions do you want to return to the Tour in the summer?**

Before I answer that, I would like to say that I had this operation done so that I could ski with my children or play soccer or tennis with my friends in the years and decades to come. My primary motivation was to get back in shape for my normal life. But I wanted to approach this demanding rehabilitation with the mentality and body of a top athlete. Would that still be possible two or three years after my retirement? I don't know. As far as my sporting ambitions are concerned, they could be summed up like this: I would like to see once again what I can achieve as a professional tennis player. I'm fighting for it and I'm very motivated.  I feel the support of my team and my family. We all wish that I can say goodbye in my own way and on a tennis court.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is saying goodbye on the court the main thing for you?**

Yes, and when you get right down to it, it doesn't make much difference whether I return in 2022 or 2023, at the age of 40 or 41. It doesn't matter. The question is rather: Will I manage to torture myself again day after day for my comeback? My heart says yes today. So I'm taking things step by step. I have experienced similar challenges many times in my career. Sometimes without the public being aware of it. And even though I know that the end is near, I want to try to play some big games again. It won't be easy, but I'll give it a try.

 

**You could divide your fans into two categories: those who can't look at seeing a Roger Federer who doesn't win any more big titles. And into those who are just happy to see you playing again. Do you understand this contrast?**

(he thinks about it) I'm a big sports fan, too, and I think that every athlete should decide for himself. There is no right time to retire. There is only the time that suits each individual athlete. It's a very personal decision. What kind of image will people remember of me? My last set at Wimbledon last July? Or my Grand Slam titles and what it triggered in them when they watched me play? My money is on the latter. For a few years now, I've been pretty relaxed about that. But I understand the fans' feelings. And it was because of them that I called you to talk frankly. My fans deserve to understand my feelings and hopes. It would be easy for me to say, ""It's okay, I've given a lot and received a lot. Let's stop here."" But the fact that I'm investing everything I have to come back once again is also my way of saying thank you to my fans. They deserve better than the image my last grass season left.

 

**Speaking of grass: Despite your meniscus tear, you reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Isn't that an encouraging sign in your situation?**

I already felt in Halle against Felix Auger-Aliassime that my Wimbledon would not be what I had hoped for. Even though I didn't know the nature of my injury yet, I knew I would be limited. But when you set everything up for a tournament - as Rafa (Nadal) probably did at Roland Garros - it's normal to put your problems aside and give everything. Besides, you always hope for a miracle. There's always a small chance... What would have happened if I had won the tiebreak of the second set against Hurkacz? When you're battered, you cling to everything: your previous victories, your experience on grass. In retrospect, I realized that I almost didn't win a point at Wimbledon when I had to defend. But yes, that Wimbledon confirmed to me that I could still play at a high level despite my limitation. And considering how far I got, I just have to try again.

 

**You said at the beginning that you don't think you'll be competing at Wimbledon in 2022. Will we see you shine again at Grand Slams?**

If I do my rehabilitation intensively, then there is a chance that I will return to a high level. If I do strength training, go on the bike, swim, do balance exercises, work on my upper body, then I believe in it. Will I return to the Tour for a smaller round or for something bigger?  Nobody knows, neither the doctors nor me. But I'm fighting for it. To be clear, my world will not collapse if I never play another Grand Slam final. But it is my ultimate dream to return once again. And in fact, I still believe in it. I believe in these kinds of miracles. I have already experienced them.  Sports history sometimes writes such miracles. I am realistic: it would be a great miracle. But there are miracles in sports.",1637135630

Either Joe Salisbury, US Open victor, Toronto Champion, and Australian Open finalist or Mate Pavic, who win Wimbledon, Miami, Monte-Carlo, and Rome, while reaching finals in Madrid and Toronto will finish the year number one.

Croatia‚Äôs Mate Pavic must win his match against Australian Open champions Dodig / Polasek in order to secure the year end number one ranking. Pavic and Mektic will face Dodig / Polasek on Thursday. 

But first, Salisbury and his partner: Rajeev Ram must beat French Open champions and Paris-Bercy finalists Herbert / Mahut tomorrow. 

Assuming Salisbury and Ram defeat the all-French duo, AND Mektic / Pavic lose on Thursday, then Ram and Salisbury must win their final round robin match (against Barcelona champions Farah / Cabal), and then win the tournament. 

Basically: if Salisbury / Ram win the tournament without losing a round robin match, and Mektic / Pavic lose tomorrow, Salisbury will finish the year number one. Otherwise, Pavic will be crowned year end number one.

Women‚Äôs Doubles:
Either Hsieh or Siniakova will finish the year number one. Hsieh / Mertens and Siniakova / Krejcikova have made the semifinals; whoever goes further from here wins. If they both lose today, Hsieh will finish number one. If both win, then they will play each other for the coveted position of year end number one.

I'd like some advice on buying a new racket, from a UK site, on a budget of ¬£120. I play 2-3 times a week, in county leagues. I am a very varied player, not really a baseliner or serve+volley player. Just finished using an old Babolat Contact Team of weight 280g. 

So far I liked the idea of having a spin themed racket, this Blade 98S caught my attention: [https://www.tennis-point.co.uk/wilson-blade-98s-countervail-tour-racket-special-edition-00703803101000.html](https://www.tennis-point.co.uk/wilson-blade-98s-countervail-tour-racket-special-edition-00703803101000.html)

But in all honesty I don't know what I am looking for, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Also I should say that I am in a very remote location so getting a demo racket from a nearby store isn't an option annoyingly.

Cheers :)",1637091380

So two days after invalidating hundreds of tickets, the tournament starts last Sunday and there are reports of people getting in even without their ""placeholder"" as it seemed any ticket would be enough for admission. As hours go by, this is confirmed over and over, while the FIT (Italian Tennis Federation, co-organisers of the event) announce that they will sit down with the CTS (Scientific Committee who is to decide on even attendances) and ask for a 7,5% increase in capacity. According to FIT, this increase would allegedly allow all ticket holders to take part. 

Monday comes along, and there is still no official word from FIT; I had tickets for the Monday night session and decided to give it a shot anyway. I show up with just the ticket and the QR code for contact tracing, and we're let in without further questions. The guy in front of me in line even admitted to not having the QR contact tracing code, to which the assistant replied ""it's ok, it doesn't matter"".

As I take my seat - which technically shouldn't even be allowed to be occupied - FIT officially announce that the CTS denied their request to increase capacity, which will stay at 60%. This is quite comical as it was clearly closer to 75%ish percent for the whole evening I spent in the venue (looked even higher for the Berrettini match on Sundat night). Today, Facebook groups were reporting that people were still admitted with an invalid seat placeholder.

FIT today publicly complained that the CTS are stuck ups who did not  accommodate the need of the public, but frankly this is a complete mess that made them look like utter clowns. Plenty of people decided not to show anyway, even cancel their other reservations, and it's impossible to predict how they will handle refunds. Will all tickets linked to an invalid placeholder be eligible? How are they going to determine who ended up attending anyway as I did? 

All in all, a bad look for the organisers who just made things worse with every decision. Media outlets still keep this very quiet, there's just too many hands reaching into this purse. The show itself was okay, although the atmosphere was pretty cold since everyone was disgruntled (the matches didn't help as they were pretty uncompetitive). A few hiccups here and there but nothing too concerning for a first-time host.

Very difficult to predict what is going to happen in the next few days - if they are going to crack down on invalid tickets or if they will just keep letting everyone in. Surely I have no idea how they are getting away with this considering all the scrutiny the event is getting from the CTS, but it's Italy so anything is possible I guess.",1637087105

This poll is about ball toss. If I am not mistaken - unless the umpire believes you are misthrowing intentionally - you have unlimited attempts. In volleyball to keep things streamlined you got only one toss and have to hit the ball no matter how good or bad the toss was. Should tennis adopt this rule? This could add quite a bit of drama with players serving for the match getting shaky hands and having to hit messed up tosses nonetheless.

21,tennis,Nadal's change of forehand against Djokovic?,"Has anyone noticed that in his rivalry with Djokovic, Nadal's pattern of forehand changes depending on if it's a grandslam or non grandslam tournament?

For example, he hits noticeably less down the line and inside out forehands when he plays Djokovic in masters tournaments than when he does in grandslams. 
He usually goes for repetitive cross court forehands in masters which in my opinion isn't as effective as when he hits a variety of forehands, particularly IO and DTL.

I remember how the DTL and IO forehands basically won him RG 2014 against Djokovic. He hit missiles that match and Novak had no counter to it. Also in W2018 and he made a lot of points out of it.

But when it comes to best of 3 sets, the story changes. I've realized that it does depend on surface a bit. He's overall more flexible on clay than hard. But even comparing clay masters and RG (ex. Rome 2012 and RG 2012), his forehand has less variety to it in M1000 tournaments. 

This is especially true in hard court games, as he barely even attempts to make DTL or IO forehands. Prime example is USO 2013 and ATP Finals 2013. The Rafa at USO had a completely different FH than the one in Finals. The courts in O2 being faster may be a factor, but then again Rafa does it more often in Wimbledon which is even faster than O2.

I'm not sure if this is a surprise tactic against Novak for grandslams. But I don't believe so.  My guess was that maybe he's not as confident against Djokovic in best of 3 sets? Or that he has more room for error in a best of 5 match? Or it's something technique wise?

1,tennis,ATP Finals Round Robin Retirement and/or Withdrawals Procedure,"A retirement counts as a match loss for the retiring player and a match win for their opponent. It counts as a match played for both. The set winning percentage takes into account the sets played in the match. The set in which the retiring player retired will count as a set loss for them and as a set win for their opponent. Neither player who participates in the match in which a player retired will have their game winning percentage affected by the match. 

If Berrettini does not withdraw from the ATP Finals (which is unlikely given the nature of the injury), his retirement in his match against Zverev will count as a loss on his record. So, his current record is 0-1. The sets he lost, including the 2nd set in which he retired, will be counted in his set winning percentage. So, his current set winning percentage is 0% (0/2). However, his game winning percentage is not affected by this loss. So, it is still 0/0 (0%). Zverev's game winning percentage is also not affected by this match and remains 0/0 (0%). 

If Berrettini withdraws from the ATP Finals, Sinner will take his place because he is the 1st alternate (the 2nd alternate is Norrie). Sinner's record will not take into account the 1 match that Berrettini played. So, for example, if Sinner wins both his round-robin matches against Medvedev and Hurkacz, he would have a 2-0 record (not 2-1 as it would have been if Berrettini's loss was factored in). 

In the round-robin groups, the 2 players with the most match wins advance to the semifinals. The winner of the red group plays the 2nd placed player in the green group in one semifinal and the winner of the green group plays the 2nd placed player in the red group in the other semifinal.

Below are the round-robin tiebreak procedures in the order that they are applied:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Greatest number of match wins. If, after applying this tiebreaker, still a 2-way tie, move on to the next tiebreaker. If, after applying this tiebreaker, still a 3-way tie: If all 3 are different in this metric, then they will be ranked in their group by this metric. If all 3 are the same, it moves to the next tiebreaker. If 2 are the same but 1 is different, the 1 who is different gets placed accordingly, and the 2 who are the same move on to the next tiebreaker.
2. Greatest number of matches played. If, after applying this tiebreaker, still a 2-way tie, move on to the next tiebreaker. If, after applying this tiebreaker, still a 3-way tie: If all 3 are different in this metric, then they will be ranked in their group by this metric. If all 3 are the same, it moves to the next tiebreaker. If 2 are the same but 1 is different, the 1 who is different gets placed accordingly, and the 2 who are the same move on to the next tiebreaker.
3. If still a 2-way tie: The winner of their round-robin match. If not a 2-way tie, move on to the next tiebreaker.
4. If still a 3-way tie, the greatest percentage of sets won. If all 3 are different, then they will be ranked in their group by this metric. If all 3 are the same, it moves to the next tiebreaker. If 2 are the same but 1 is different, the 1 who is different gets placed accordingly, and the 2 who are the same are placed based on who won their round-robin match. If they did not play a round-robin match (which would happen with Sinner and Zverev if Berrettini withdraws), move on to the next tiebreaker.
5. If still a 3-way tie: Greatest percentage of games won. If all 3 are different, then they will be ranked in their group by this metric. If all 3 are the same, it moves to the next tiebreaker. If 2 are the same but 1 is different, the 1 who is different gets placed accordingly, and the 2 who are the same are placed based on who won their round-robin match. If they did not play a round-robin match (which would happen with Sinner and Zverev if Berrettini withdraws), move on to the next tiebreaker.

98,tennis,Tennis TV media channel is amazing,"I‚Äôm new to tennis and one of the first things I noticed is just how funny and entertaining the Tennis TV YouTube channel is. It feels more like a fan-built channel than the official media of the tour‚Ä¶.which is great.

It really knows what fans find entertaining and just gives zero shits. Throws its own umpires and commentators totally under the bus. Zooms in on arguments between players. Makes fun of fans and players when they‚Äôre doing / saying dumb stuff. In addition to providing great match and player highlights and behind the scenes practices, interviews, etc.

I‚Äôve never seen anything like it from an official media for a sport. Has it always been this good?",1636825345
99,tennis,My experience with the ATP Finals ticket fiasco,"Preface: the Covid situation is currently under control in Italy (we have a rather high vaccination rate) but there are still some limitations to maximum capacity of venues for sporting events/concerts, which are currently capped at 60%.

My experience: I bought 2 tickets for the Monday evening session last February, well aware that Covid may be still looming large by then. Nonetheless, I received no communication from the ATP Finals until a few days ago, when an email prompted me to register for the contact tracing platform (par of the course for events in the past few months) and a mysterious ""placeholder"". The former went well, while trying to register for the latter returned a generic error. I decided to wait a few more hours because hey, I had the ticket and just a couple days to go before the match so I surely would be going right?

Wrong: last night a few other friends of mine had the same problem with the ""placeholder"", whose procedure now returned a screen saying that my tickets had no assigned seat and where thus not valid for access. After some confusion, the situation became clear: the organisers had overbooked the event, and now people were getting their tickets cancelled with a couple days' notice. 

Apparently, the organisers planned for 100% capacity, and then asked the Department of Health for an exception to at least 75%, which was promptly denied; they had no choice but to cancel 40% of the seats, claiming last purchased would be the first to be canceled. All while the official website still had tickets on sale! 

Everybody suddenly realised what was going on, and rifghtfully got mad: paying spectators - many of whom had bought the tickets months in advance - were getting screwed over while all the corporate seats, their clients, FIT (Italy's tennis federation) cronies and friends of friends had their nice assigned place weeks in advance and were untouched. So basically the oganisers took our money when they needed it, and now will issue refunds - if claimed - from Dec 1st. Basically like taking out a loan with no interest! Social media in Italian has been all over this, but the media of course are turning a blind eye even though there have been a few reports on major outlets in the past few hours.

Needless to say, I'm incredibly disappointed and frankly - as someone born and raised in Turin - a bit ashamed of the situation. For me not much changes, it's just going to be another Monday night, but what about those who booked flights/trains, accommodation, time off work, and possibly made sacrifices to enjoy the show just to be left out of the gates 2 days before? Absolutely embarrassing. There's even speculation (not confirmed) that the more expensive tickets for more premium sections bought just in the past few days are being given priority over regular tickets bought long ago. I don't know about these rumours, but certainly there's a lot of unhappy people in Turin right now and it has definitely ruined the mood for fans.

Anyway, I am sorry if anyone on here found themselves in the middle of this shitshow, I hope you make the most of your time in town anwyay - at least there's plenty to see and do until the end of the tourney and feel free to ask if you want any suggestions or recommendations.",1636825332

Here are some of the questions I have, any help with any of these is much appreciated:

1) How do I what these ticket plans will actually cost?  I'd like to get four of them for our entire family, but not if they end up being too expensive. 

2) If we don't go the route of buying a ticket ""plan"", will there eventually be a way to purchase single day, single session tickets? 

3) Is it possible to purchase tickets at a point in time after one knows which exact players will be playing on which courts and when?   Or, is it the case that by the time the scheduling of matches is made that all tickets are sold?",1636812061

I hope this post finds all of you well!
I have a ticket for the final (ATP organisation, please don't cancel my ticket!) and I have a doubt regarding the Final schedule.
From the site (and the documents) 2:30 pm it's the starting hour. But correct me if I'm wrong, the first match will be the doubles final, right?
And what time should I expect for the singles final? (4pm)?
I'm asking this because I will be staying in Milan not in Turin and I'm concerned about the possibility of not catching the last train to Milan (rent a car is a possibility but not the Ideal)

31,tennis,Depth analysis by country - PART 2,"I posted a chart earlier today that attempted to analyze which countries had the greatest player depth. It was a bit confusing, so I decided to try a different approach. 

User ""Special-Vegetable138"" suggested using ""cross country style"" scoring, which means you add up the rankings of each country's top ranked players, and lowest score wins. So for example if Country X's top five players are ranked 2, 5, 10, 13, and 20, that country's score would be 2 + 5 + 10 + 13 + 20 = 50.

It's a good idea, but the problem with that approach is, how do you decide how many players to factor into the ranking? For example, if you use 4 players, Russia will dominate since it has 4 players in the top 30. But if you use 10 players, Russia falls far behind since their player quality falls off sharply after their #4 ranked player.

So I ran the analysis 15 times, using each country's top 1 to 15 players. Every country with at least one player in the top 200 is represented. Players outside the top 1000 are not included. If a country did not have any additional players inside the top 1000, it did not get a rank.

Here are the results. I think there are some very interesting trends in here. As expected, the deepest countries are USA, Spain, France, and Italy. Russia, Serbia, and Canada have excellent players at the top, but not so much further down.

Of course, this is just a snap shot based on the current live rankings. This chart is constantly evolving as players move up and down the rankings.

The 2009 heartbreak final.. It felt like the culmination of their rivalry. Fed being down a break in the 5th...and somehow still coming back. Oh, and THAT rally. Seemed like some anime shit

55,tennis,Depth analysis by country,"Inspired by the observation that American men's tennis is extremely deep right now, but doesn't have a lot of players near the top.

Here's a quick chart I made showing each country's Nth ranked player, and where they stand in relation to other countries. Some interesting trends in here. USA, Spain, France, Argentina, and Australia seem to have the best overall depth within the top 200. Russia, Italy, and Serbia have a handful of quality players but then fall off fast.

Actually i Have wilson  blade 98 (16/19) countervail 304g 632cm^2. Generally its Ok, weight is good, but sometimes i Have a struggle with hitting the ball With frame and Have clean shot. Also slice is my problem. Im thinking about wilson blade 104 sw v7.0 306g 671cm^2. So it Have a lot bigger head so i think it would be easier to get that clean shot. Its on sale now (67%) so it look like a good offer. Can you tell me if it will be good change? Thx",1636744765

Yet so many times I ended up hitting the ball over the gated fence of the Tennis courts and I lost a lot of Tennis balls this way (over 20 already!).

What am I doing wrong? And yes I tried looking for schools an coaches but in my part of the world the pandemic is still causing strong policies an I live in an isolated location so I'd have to drive far for live lessons.

91,tennis,Next Gen Group B scenario matrix," 

I love the round robin format because it can lead to wacky scenarios. Many of you probably already know how this works but I thought I'd spell it all out, since we have some interesting possibilities in Next Gen Group B going into Day 3.

On Day 2 of Round Robin play, Day 1 winners play Day 1 winners and Day 1 losers play Day 1 losers. So after 2 days you always wind up with one player at 2-0, one player at 0-2, and two players at 1-1.

On Day 3, players play whoever they haven't played yet. If the 0-2 player ends up playing the 2-0 player (leaving the 1-1 players to play each other), the 2-0 player automatically advances and the 1-1 players are vying for the second place slot. This is the more boring outcome (e.g. Group A where Alcaraz is guaranteed to advance, and Nakashima plays Rune for the second spot).

But in about 50% of cases, you have the 2-0 player playing a 1-1 player, and the 0-2 player playing the other 1-1 player. In this case, we get the SCENARIO MATRIX, i.e. a 6x6 table with each axis having the following possibilities: X wins in 3, X wins in 4, X wins in 5, Y wins in 3, Y wins in 4, Y wins in 5.

(Thanks to user Luck1492 for correctly pointing out in my deleted post that Next Gen is best of 5!)

In half of the possible outcomes, you end up with a 3-way tie and the deciding factor is percentage of sets won (or games if there's still a 3-way tie).

In the current case, we end up with the following (color coded for each unique combination of players):

https://preview.redd.it/flbg67iknvy71.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61cc212d37aa9e6c5336f41b41d6360f9e128b93

A few notes:

\-Korda is guaranteed to advance UNLESS Baez wins in 3 and Musetti wins in 3.

\-Gaston has the most difficult path. He must win AND Musetti must lose in order for him to advance.

\-Baez and Musetti both must win to advance, but a win does not guarantee advancement. Baez can guarantee advancement by winning in 3.

\-The scenarios with an asterisk have a 2-way tie for second place in percentage of sets won. I believe those cases are decided by head-to-head record but I'm not certain of that.

\-Baez vs. Gaston is on first tomorrow. Depending on the outcome, Korda and Musetti will know exactly what they need to do to advance. For example, suppose Gaston wins and Korda decides he wants to screw over Gaston to help his buddy Musetti. He can then throw his match against Musetti, and both will still advance (but Korda would have to play Alcaraz in the semis).

I did this pretty quick so I may have made a mistake. Sorry if someone else already posted this, I always look forward to this scenario every year!",1636598351

In 8 of the 16 possible outcomes, you end up with a 3 way tie and the deciding factor is the percentage of sets won (or games if there's still a 3-way tie).

In the current case, we end up with the following:

A few notes:

\-Korda is guaranteed to advance, but his standing in the group (1st or 2nd) is TBD.

\-Gaston has the most difficult path. He must win AND Musetti must lose in order for him to advance.

\-Baez and Musetti both must win to advance, but a win does not guarantee advancement. Baez will definitely advance if he wins in 2, which would also prevent Musetti from advancing regardless of his result.

\-One scenario I'm not quite sure about is Baez in 3, Musetti in 3. In this scenario we have a 3 way tie between Korda, Baez, and Musetti. Korda advances with 64% of sets won, but Baez and Musetti are still tied at 50% sets won. In this case I believe it reverts to head-to-head matchups in which Baez would advance.

Be it about not getting scared by opponents that hit the ball much harder than you or about staying calm in tense situations or about sticking to your game plan instead of playing your opponents game or whatsover...

My favorite tennis quote is about dealing with frustration and comes from Laura Siegemund who is not only a entertaining player but also has a bachelor degree in psychology (thesis about ""Choking under Pressure""). She said:

""In jedem Match ist irgendwas richtig schei√üe!""  
In english: ""In every match something totally sucks!""

To me, this quote is as genius as it is simple.   
The very moment I heard it I immediately knew I had been approaching matches wrongly all my life. I used to step on the court and hope or even expect to play a perfect match (fitting my level of tennis of course) and get mad when I didn't. ""D\*\*n, my backhand was so solid in last training! Why is it so shitty today?!"" ""Six double faults in one set? Who am I? Sascha Zverev?!"" and so on...

Thanks to Laura now I know that whenever I step on the court I am about to face struggle and that a match is not about playing perfect tennis but about overcoming adversities - be it the opponent, wind, sun, bad bounces, whatsoever. This mindset has helped me keeping my composure and ultimately made me a better player.

71,tennis,"Nitto ATP Finals 2021 - Qualified Players List, Big Names Missing","ATP Tour concluded this week with Novak Djokovic winning the last ATP Masters 1000 Tournament. The Serbian star beat World No. 2, Daniil Medvedev, by 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in Paris Masters. With this title win, he broke Rafael Nadal's record of 36 ATP Tour titles.

Big name, Roger Federer, most ATP Finals titles, 6, will miss this event as he continues his recovery after knee surgery in August. Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal will also sit this one out, the first time since 2004, after failing to secure top-8 in ATP Rankings.

Nitto ATP Finals 2021 will be conducted in Turin, Italy from 14-21 November.

Here is the list of top-8 elites who qualified for this year's last Tennis tournament.

1. Novak Djokovic
2. Daniil Medvedev
3. Alexander Zverev
4. Stefanos Tsitsipas
5. Andrey Rublev
6. Matteo Berrettini
7. Hubert Hurkacz
8. Casper Rudd

Pressureless balls \*help\* keep the ball in the court at this altitude but these balls still fly and they're hard as a rock.

People gave him hard time for PTPA as they were following Feds and Nadal's PR tweets that said: ""We need to be united more than ever"", while PTPA-s goal is to help less fortunate, lower-ranked players.   
The media proclaimed him as an Anti-Vaxer as well and if you dig any deeper than just reading the headlines you would know it was taken out of context. To this day he did not disclose if he is unvaxxed and he even said that he does believe in modern medicine.   
I believe he is way more vocal about it in Serbian interview-s which might be his fault, but after years of lies about him presented in the mainstream media, he might be sick of trying to convince people otherwise.

17,tennis,Some 2021 Masters season stats,"Now that the last 2021 M1000 tournament is over, here are some interesting stats from this season. When comparing them across different years, I'm only considering the time period beginning in 2009, when (most) Masters became mandatory for top players.

* In 8 tournaments we've seen **7 different champions** (Hurkacz, Tsitsipas, Zverev, Nadal, Medvedev, Norrie, and Djokovic). Previously the highest number of champions in a single season was 6 (2010, 2018, 2019; NB all these seasons had 9 M1000 tournaments, while 2021 only had 8). \[This has happened before 2009, however ‚Äî last time in 2003.\] The lowest number of champions per season is 3 (2013: Nadal, Murray, Djokovic; 2015: Djokovic, Murray, Federer). There were also only 2 champions in 2020, but that doesn't count.
* **3 players won their first 1000 titles** this year. This has been kinda-sorta the standard since 2017, when every year (2017‚Äì2019, 2021) there were exactly three first-time champions. What's more interesting is that in the 8 whole seasons before 2017, i.e. 2009‚Äì2016, there was a grand total of 5 first-time champions: 2 in 2010, 1 in each of 2012, 2014, and 2016.
* There were **12 different Masters finalists** this year. This also happened in 2019. Only 4 people made two finals: Zverev, Rublev, Djokovic, and Medvedev. It's the first time on tour that no player has made more than 2 Masters finals.  The lowest number of different finalists in a Masters season is 6 (2015: Big 4 + Berdych, Tsonga).
* **For 7/12 those were their first Masters finals**: Hurkacz, Sinner, Rublev, Berrettini, Opelka, Norrie, and Basilashvili. Previously the highest number of different first-time finalists we had was 5 in 2019.
* In doubles, **Mektiƒá/Paviƒá made 5 consecutive finals** this year (Miami through Toronto), winning 3 of them. It's a new record; Bryan brothers had 4 finals in a row on 3 different occasions, once even winning 4 titles in a row, but they never made 5 consecutive finals.
* Andrey Rublev has made finals in both singles (Monte Carlo, Cincinnati) and doubles (Indian Wells) this season. Players that have also done this before him are Tsitsipas (2019), Thiem (2019), Isner (2018, 2016, 2012), Khachanov (2018), Sock (2017), Andy Murray (2013), Nadal (2012, 2010), Federer (2011), and Fish (2011). Only two of these players have managed to win a Masters title in both categories in one season. You can try to guess for yourself who they were, here's the answer: &gt;!John Isner in 2018 and Rafael Nadal in both 2012 and 2010.!&lt;

Another reminder that this season only had 8 M1000 tournaments, unlike all before it that had 9.

We all know this year has been *chaotic:* we went from a Hurkacz‚ÄîSinner final to a Norrie‚ÄîBasilashvili final, and wrapped it up nicely with No. 1 beating No. 2 in the last Masters of the season. Nothing to look at. In all seriousness, it's good to see so many new players emerge and compete for big titles; perhaps the time of NextGen has indeed come.

Also if you needed more proof to how miserable it was to be a non Big-4 pro before 2017, this is it.",1636474228
18,tennis,Why is PTPA discussion outside this sub so full of misinformation?,,1636474084
19,tennis,"So‚Ä¶Next Gen finals have timed toilet breaks; 3 minutes from the time they reach the toilet, and an additional 2 minutes if they beed to change their kit. Why can‚Äôt the main tour incorporate this?",,1636473815
20,tennis,Don't hate on the WTA for being less consistent,"As a big fan of both the ATP and the WTA I don't like when people automatically say women's tennis is boring. Besides the level of tennis, many people allude to the fact that anyone can win a slam on a given period and there's absolutely no dominance on the tour.
I think there are many things one should point out when discussing this. 

First of all, in both tours there are cycles of dominance and relative parity. Without needing to go so far back to Evert, Martina or Graf and Seles I think people forget that the WTA used to be much more consistent 10 years ago. Watching the Williams sisters, Sharapova, Azarenka or Kvitova was expected in the last rounds of slams and it wasn't always the case that a Raducanu or an Ostapenko would win slams. Also due to the absurd dominance of the Big 4 in the ATP people forget the men's tour wasn't always like this. Late 90s and early 00s for example, you'd have many one or two time slam winners or short term no 1s (Moya, Kafelnikov, Johansson, R√≠os to name a few). The fact that 5 people have won 3 slams plus in the last 20 years (roughly) is an anomaly and not the norm.

Another factor that isn't talked about enough in this context is the fact that women's slams are BO3. Being fit to play long matches, being composed and mentally tough to close out or recover in a big match after 3 or 4 hours is a serious skill that differentiates legends from good players (just remember how many times Rafa or Nole have come back from the dead). Furthermore, the longer a match, the lower the element of luck and the probability of an upset. I am certain that if slams were BO5 there would be fewer winners on the women's side and significantly more domination. One can think of how good Zverev is in Master's compared to GS.

Lastly there are significant differences between the duration and the peak of careers of male and female tennis players that should not be discounted. I am not an expert, but I don't believe it's coincidence that many players like Hingis, Sharapova or Seles had won multiple slams at 19, while this is hardly the case for men. Women peak earlier and a young champion is thought of being a sign of a weak tour. Men probably take more time to develop physically and the game is more demanding. Also they tend to have longer careers (women might want to start a family or their bodies might not be able to bear this absurd load for too long). Again, I don't know well the anatomical differences and their implications but these things are not random.

So to sum up, sure this is currently an era where there are many one hit wonders in the women's tour and the top players often struggle in big games. But one should remember it wasn't always like this neither for men, nor for women and there are many reasons that enable this phenomenon to take place. Women's tennis is still exciting to watch i believe. Sorry for the long post.",1636471923

*""The experienced German coach Torben Beltz is in line to become Emma Raducanu‚Äôs next coach after holding meetings with her and agent Chris Helliar near her home in Orpington.*

*Beltz is best-known for his work with Angelique Kerber, the former Wimbledon champion, but news emerged on Monday that the two Germans have split. Beltz would thus be free to join Raducanu in time for the off-season and January‚Äôs Australian Open.*

*Raducanu, who is preparing for the Linz Open in Austria, revealed on Sunday that she would have a new coach in place for the Australian Open, saying: ""I had some trials \[with potential coaches\] and they went well .‚Äù She did not, however, reveal the coach‚Äôs name.*

*It is understood, however, that Beltz is in prime position. The 44-year-old and Raducanu were photographed together with Helliar, at the A Mano Coffee Bar and Kitchen in Orpington, close to Raducanu's Bromley home. The picture was uploaded to a Raducanu Instagram fans' site on Oct 20.*

*The only other coach who is known to have trialled with Raducanu is Esteban Carril, who formerly worked with Johanna Konta, but he is in Stockholm this week with Andy Murray, performing another trial with a view to joining Jamie Delgado in Murray‚Äôs backroom staff.*

*Kerber is a fine example of a player who made every ounce of her ability count. In 2011, she was ranked a lowly No77 when she became the first Wimbledon victim of 17-year-old British phenomenon Laura Robson. Few would have imagined then that it would be Kerber ‚Äì rather than Robson ‚Äì who wound up with three major titles.*

*On Monday, however, Kerber announced in an interview for Porsche Tennis magazine that she and Beltz are splitting at the end of this season. ‚ÄúI would like to take on more responsibility,‚Äù Kerber said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very grateful for our time together and for everything we experienced and achieved as a team.‚Äù*

*Beltz did not have much of a playing career. He is listed as having appeared in a couple of low-level matches in 2000, when he would have been 23, but does not seem to have had a professional ranking.*

*As a coach, however, he has established a strong reputation as a reliable, reassuring operator. He would certainly seem a strong choice for Raducanu‚Äôs first coach as a regular member of the WTA Tour.*

*As Raducanu said in September, when she announced that she would not be continuing with her US Open coach Andrew Richardson, ‚ÄúI really need someone right now that has had that WTA Tour experience at the high levels.‚Äù*",1636455474

Before Medvedev's US Open title this year my answer was definitely Zverev as he won more M1000s and ATP 500s overall and have been ranked in the top 10 for longer.

Although Zverev's Olympic Gold probably offsets Medvedev's USO. I say they are pretty equal as of now in terms of achievements. Also bear in mind their h2h is 5-5 now so if you put them on court against each other it is basically a coin toss.

I personally rate slams higher than Olympic Golds so I say Daniil is slightly ahead as of now Although both will win many more big titles I am sure.

While I had a detention for 3 months after school. She then forcefully meddled with matches because a Kid I was supposed to play was talking to her about it and she said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play him‚Äù I waited a 45M then I posted it on the team chat as my default win, and he replies Coach ________ Said not to play you. It isn‚Äôt his fault but I got no notification and wasted my time.

Wasn‚Äôt allowed to play in the district tournaments and they lost. Primarily because she didn‚Äôt let the best in the girls division play and wanted to give other players an opportunity after a thrashing. Top 1-3 weren‚Äôt allowed to play singles.

93,tennis,Scenarios for Djokovic and Medvedev in RR,"I'll assume Tsitsipas won't retire from Turin.  


So Djokovic and Medvedev are of course, on different groups, then the players that can't be in the same group are:  


Number 3 and 4: Zverev and Tsitsipas

Number 5 and 6: Rublev and Berrettini

Number 7 and 8: Hurkacz and Ruud  


With the number 3 and 4 because of recent form (and worse considering injury) Tsitsipas would be the preferable option for any of them, Zverev, in spite of the 6-2 6-2 loss, is no joke for any of them and the 3 setter at the ATP Cup is probably a better indicator of a match against Medvedev in the pretty much likely fast conditions in Turin, Djokovic has played Zverev 4 times this year and none have been easy for any of them, he would pretty much avoid this match up in the first rounds.

For number 5 and 6, while we haven't seen the Rublev Djokovic match up, I think Rublev just doesn't have the weapons to hurt him. Now, the good news for both Djokovic and Medvedev is that neither of the 5 and 6 have a particular good form right now, Rublev has been losing to opponents he shouldn't and Berrettini can't get rhythm because of injuries, but given the match ups I'd believe Medvedev would prefer Berrettini, he dominated him in the ATP Cup and, while he could maybe take some clues from Djokovic vs Medvedev match, doing more slices, going to the net, without match play it's hard to implement that successfully, also, because of Rublev recent win over him which might give him confidence. Djokovic would likely face Rublev who is in bad form and who doesn't have the weapons to unfaze him, Berrettini showed in Wimbledon and RG that he can do damage with his game and given this is BO3 and with the motivation of being in Italy he could trouble him.  


Number 7 and 8 is clear for me, Medvedev would pretty much avoid Hurkacz who beat him at Wimbledon and had the chances to beat him in Canada, plus this is indoor HC which won't favour the heavy spin forehand of Ruud compared to Medvedev gamestyle, Djokovic will likely want to avoid someone who probably got confidence from pushing him to a third set tiebreak last week also so Ruud is the choice here.

60,tennis,Djokovic appreciation post... from a Fedfan,"I was in the audience today (behaving myself, unlike some), and I was blessed to see some great tennis but also to understand truly for the first time why Novak is so good.

I was cheering for Hurkacz in the semi and for Meddy today, both because I find them both quite likable and I generally root for the underdog. But also because I always found Novak's game unremarkable and he broke my heart too many times against Roger. I never really liked Djokovic.

That stopped today. He may be less inspired off court obviously but it's impossible to deny his genius on the court and how incredible he is as an athlete.

He is stronger physically: it shows a lot more in 5 setters but still, in a grueling match today with incredibly intense rallies, he stayed strong in the 3rd set (perhaps even gathering pace) while Meddy looked beat and started accumulating unforced errors.

He is stronger tactically: he couldn't deal with Daniil from the baseline and decided to come to the net everytime he had a chance, which I thought was very unlike him but turned out to be game breaking. 

He is stronger mentally: I guess that's one thing I already knew as a Fedfan!

He is so incredibly well rounded: strong serve, groundstrokes, volleys (!), he defends incredibly well, obviously returns serves amazingly well, even has a good dropshot, even puts his overhead smashes in the court more often than not!

He has a beast of a forehand: that was the least obvious one to me because Roger and Rafa have amazing forehands and I never realised Novak's was so good, this is what saved him today in combination with his volleys.

I will no longer be frustrated when he bags every single record there is left, and inevitably I think when he overtakes Rafa and Roger in number of slams.

I just wish he would stop speaking nonsense off court but I guess I won't pay too much attention to that now. 

TLDR: just saw today from the audience how an amazing champion he is.",1636309423
61,tennis,Djokovic has won the last 3 hard court Masters tournaments he has played and is on a 14 match winning streak at hard court Masters tournaments,"The last 3 hard court Masters tournaments that Djokovic played were the 2019 Paris Masters, the 2020 Cincinnati Masters, and the 2021 Paris Masters. Djokovic won all 3. 

His 14 match winning streak at hardcourt Masters tournaments is from winning 5 matches on the way to the 2019 Paris Masters title, winning 5 matches on the way to the 2020 Cincinnati title, and winning 4\* matches on the way to the 2021 Paris Masters title.

66,tennis,What if both players had to stand behind the service line while serving in doubles?,"As someone who loves to play doubles recreationally, I'm always disappointed when I watch professional doubles. It's so just boring. Most points are over in under 3 shots, and this is due to the massive advantage the serving side gets. A returner essentially has to hit in the one third of their court court just to start the point off at a slight disadvantage. Fail that and the point is over immediately. 

In fact, I calculated it: here are the percentage of sets that went to tiebreaks in all the men's doubles grand slams:
US Open: 27.5% 
Wimbledon. 26.1%
French Open: 19.5%
Australian Open: 25.2%

This is way too high in my opinion. So what if the rule was changed that forced the serving parter to stay behind the baseline on the serve? After a return falls in, normal play resumes. Doubles has some of the most entertaining points in the rare case that it can going, and this rule change would help that out a lot. But I'm just a novice and semi invested fan, so who cares what I think.",1636306761

He also had general warm relation with crowd in many occassions both in French Open and Paris Masters. I think it's similar in Italy when crowd really likes Novak.

This year, Griekspoor already won the Challenger titles in: Prague, Bratislava, Amersfoort, Murcia, and he won two titles in two different Challengers in Naples (a.k.a. Napoli).


Before this year, he only won two Challenger titles - one in 2018 (Tampere) and one in 2019 (Banja Luka)

With this win, Griekspoor will jump to the 72nd ATP rank, which is better than his previous best - the 88th spot.

However, there's no rest for one of the best Challenger players, as he is already scheduled to play in a Challenger tournament in Bratislava next week (unless he pulls out in meantime)

Speaking of Challenger tournaments, the (so far) undisputed GOAT of the Challengers is the now retired Spaniard - Rub√©n Ram√≠rez Hidalgo.

He is the player with most wins on Challenger tournaments. On top of that he won 11 singles titles (and participated in 13 other finals that he lost) aaand he also won 21 doubles tournaments.

Interestingly, all of the finals that Hidalgo played are on clay!

Another interesting fact - Hidalgo's best ATP position was the 50th rank, so we'll see of Griekspoor will go above that.

So far, Griekspoor played 11 Challenger finals in singles' competition and he lost only twice.",1636300028

This would mean Sinner would have a spot, which are awesome news!

Even if (in the best-case scenario for Medvedev) Medvedev reaches the final and beats Djokovic there, the points difference between the two will be at least 1500 points in the next official release of the Race to Turin rankings. There are 1500 points available in the rest of the season after the Paris Masters (just Tour Finals because Stockholm's 250 points are not available for Medvedev because the release of the draw confirmed he will not be playing it), so Medvedev (who was the last player remaining in contention other than Djokovic) will at best be able to tie Djokovic in terms of points by the end of the season.

Well, here we are at the end of the season. As a special present, I'm actually doing this on time. While there are certainly surprises left in store, its time to commemorate a great year for one of the Italian next gen: Jannik Sinner.

- Age: 20
- Ranking: 10
- Notable Results: RG QF, Miami F, 500 W
- Notable Wins: Zverev, Tsitsipas, Rublev
- Strengths: Power, Movement, Composure
- Weaknesses: Serve, Variety, Plan B

To get it out of the way quickly, Sinner absolutely slams the ball. He has an easy power that only escalates as he gains rhythm in a rally. He has a wonderful wrist lag on both wings, and really turns through his shots. He's already matching top players for power while far from his physical prime, which doesn't bode well for anyone that'll have to face him in the future. Every shot just keeps coming back faster and faster until eventually there's no way to return it.

Did you Sinner used to be a skier? I certainly did due to overzealous commentators, but it shows in his game. He has an almost Djokovic-esque balance, letting him take full swings at shots while in poor positions. This, combined with great footspeed, makes him a defensive nightmare. Even when opponents have him on the run, he still remains a huge threat, as any shot could suddenly be returned with interest. (As a personal aside, I do wonder if cross sport training will become more prevalent to try and develop specific talents like this.)

As many picked up on during his first couple tournaments, Sinner is remarkably calm. While he certainly isn't perfect under pressure, he's far ahead of the curve. Maintaining a calm presence on court is one of the first steps to creating doubt in your opponent. If they never see you get frustrated, they know you're always in the match. This is why I never understand why people think Paire with a forehand would be a great - even if he had that shot, everyone knows he's one meltdown away from giving up.

One of the main factors holding Sinner back currently is his serve. Earlier in this season it was his accuracy that was the problem, but recently its become the consistency. It's impossible to tell when he'll actually be putting first serves in the box. In a game that is rapidly becoming dominated by giants with huge serves, this is a death sentence. If you can't match their hold rate, you're at an extreme disadvantage. Luckily, he has been improving. His serving throughout the indoor season has been quite good, with a couple exceptions.

What has not improved is his variety. I can probably count the number of dropshots he's played this season on one hand, and his volleys are just poor. Quite a few of his losses can be attributed to this weakness; others have been able to draw him into cat and mouse games at net, which has left him vulnerable. The concern continues to be whether this will be focus for him. Its easy to ignore these as minor parts of the game, but that neglect provides an avenue for weaker players to upset him.

Continuing with that lack of variety, Sinner lacks any real sort of Plan B when he's having a poor day. His serve isn't good enough to carry him through matches, and his easy power makes it hard to stay consistent when his timing is off. As is commonly said, the mark of a great is being able to win even when they aren't playing their best. Sinner needs to find that ability, because being unable to grind your way into form over the course of a tournament will kill far too many chances at big titles.

More than likely, Sinner will end up at the top of the game. His style is effective, his mentality is there, and the rate of improvement has been amazing. I fully believe he can win 5 or possibly more slams, though as always nothing is a given.

Well, that's it for this year! I've had a great time writing these, and being able to discuss with so many people. In between now and the start of next season I might start some other projects, though as always I'm open to suggestions. Thanks for reading these everyone!",1636206571

2. **Is the Is 4 3/8 a good guess for a men's racquet?**
3. **What type of strings for beginner who wants more control -- especially when it comes to serves? (material, tension, gauge, anything else)?**
4. **What color/brand strings would match Nike Men's Court Air Zoom GP Turbo French Open Tennis Shoes in** **turquoise, white, and black? (Want to try to avoid all black!)**

**Hi!** I haven't played tennis since I was in middle school, but my boyfriend plays several times a week and has for quite some time. He's been eyeing this racket (**Wilson** **Pro Staff** **Six.One** **(18x20) V13 Tennis Racquet**) for a long time, but it's super expensive so he hasn't pulled the trigger. He's been absolutely amazing to me, and I want to get him something grand to celebrate our time together (almost anniversary) and for Christmas.

He's kind of a beginner, so I've seen that you're not really supposed to buy a heavy (?) racquet, but he's been pretty stuck on this racquet. That being said... I cannot seem to figure out the following:

1. **Racquet:** Is the **Pro Staff** **Six.One** **(18x20) V13 Tennis Racquet** a good racquet and gift -- even if he's a ""beginner?"" (I've never seen him play, so I really don't know if he's beginner or intermediate...).
2. **Size**: I read that 4 3/8 is typical for men. He's got pretty big hands, but I also read that you can use overgrip (?) to make the handle bigger if it's too small. **Is 4 3/8 a good guess?**
3. **Strings:** There seem to be countless types of strings... with various... everything... What would you suggest for a **beginner** who **wants more control over the racquet (especially when serving)? (material, tension, gauge, ...?)**
4. **Color of Strings:** I know this doesn't really matter, but I just got him a pair of Nike tennis court shoes (**Nike Men's Court Air Zoom GP Turbo French Open Tennis Shoes**) in **turquoise, white, and black**. It's probably not as important as material, tension, etc., but any recommendations for a specific color/brand that matches?

**Thanks in advance!!** I really appreciate any and all help! I need to order soon because of the supply chain issues!

First Alcaraz and now Medvedev, it feels like it's almost forced and way too much. So much it stops the opponent from focusing on the match.

Atp finals is the tournament where the world's best 8 players come to play so tickets will be sold definitely .In small countries atp tournaments most of the players don't even come . So everyone would come to watch the best player .
It will help to grow sport 
The country will be in benefit

Below are the Stockholm Open scenarios in which each player would qualify for Tour Finals (should Hurkacz lose his QF). Please let me know if you see any errors in my calculations. I tried to do them as carefully as possible, but it's possible that there could be errors.

Hurkacz would qualify in Stockholm if any one of the following occurs:

* Hurkacz reaches Stockholm final
* Hurkacz reaches Stockholm semifinals and Sinner does not win Stockholm title
* Hurkacz reaches Stockholm quarterfinals and Sinner does not win Stockholm title
* Sinner does not reach Stockholm final and Norrie does not win Stockholm

Sinner would qualify in Stockholm if any one of the following occurs:

* Sinner wins Stockholm and Hurkacz does not reach Stockholm final
* Sinner reaches Stockholm final and Hurkacz does not reach Stockholm quarterfinals and Norrie does not win Stockholm title

Norrie would qualify in Stockholm if any one of the following occurs:

About three years ago, Zhang Gaoli vice president, you retired. You asked Dr. Liu at the Tianjin Tennis Centre to contact me, and ask me with play tennis with you at Kang Ming Hotel in Beijing. After we finished playing tennis, you and your wife Kang Jie brought me to your home. Then you take me into your room. Like what happened ten years ago in Tianjin, you wanted to have sex with me.

That afternoon I was very afraid. I did not expect this to happen - someone helped guard outside (translator note: not very clear what she's trying to say here), because nobody would believe that a wife would allow this. About seven years ago, we had sex. Then later on after you got promoted to be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee in Beijing, you have never contacted me again. I used to bury everything inside me. After all, if you don't want to take any responsibility, why do you come back to me, and brought me to your home to have sex? It is true that I don't have evidence. It is also not possible to leave evidence. Later on you kept denying, but it is true that you were attracted to me first, otherwise I couldn't have been able to come into contact with you.

That afternoon I didn't agree, and I kept crying. I had dinner with you and auntie Kang Jie together. You said the universe is very very big. The earth is merely a speck of sand in the universe , and us human beings are smaller than even a speck of sand. You said a lot more than that, and the purpose is basically to persuade me to lower my guard. After dinner, I was still not willing to have sex. You said you hate me. You said in those seven years, you never forgot about me, and you will treat me well etc... I was terrified and anxious. Taking into consideration the affection I had for you seven years ago, I agreed... yes, we had sex.

Romantic attraction is such a complicated thing, can't explain it clearly. From that day on, I renewed my love for you. Throughout my time with you after that, purely based on our interactions, you are a very good person, and you treated me well. We talking about recent history, as well as ancient eras. You educated me on so many topics, and we had discussions about economics, politics. We never ran out of things to talk about. We played chess, sang, played table tennis, played pool and also played tennis together. We always had endless fun. It was as if our personalities fit perfectly together.

I left home early (*translator note: professional athletes in China frequently leave their families at a very early age to train full-time*). On the inside, I am extremely deprived of love. In the middle of all of this, I never thought I was a good woman. I hate myself, I hate why I came to this world. You told me you love me, very very much, and you said you hope in the next life, we can meet each other around the age of twenty, or eighteen. You said you were lonely. You pitied yourself for being alone. We had endless things to talk about, never ran out of topics. You said in your position, it is impossible to divorce. If we met in Shandong (*translator note: a province of China, of less political significance than Beijing*), you would have been able to divorce, but not now. I thought I would just accompany you quietly, not making any noise.

At the beginning, everything was fine. But as time goes on, things started to change gradually. There was so much unfairness and humiliation. Every time you tell me to go to you home, behind your back your wife said so many ugly and hurtful things to me. All kinds of jeer and mockery. I said I like to eat duck tongue. Auntie Kang Jie would go, ""ew so disgusting"". In the winter when Beijing had poor air quality due to smog, auntie Kang Jie would say, ""it is because you live in the countryside. We don't feel that at all here"". Things like that, she said so much of them. When you were with me, she never said those things. It is similar to when we were together. When we were together alone, you acted one way, but when there were other people near by, you would act another way.

I have told you this before, hearing those things made me feel very hurt and humiliated deep down. Since the first day when I knew you, I have never used a cent of your money, neither have I ever used you to obtain any benefits for myself, but this thing called reputation, is so important. Everything that has happened, I deserve it. I have brought everything upon myself.

From the beginning to the end, you told me to keep our relationship a secret, and most importantly of all, I was to never tell your mom we were having sexual relationships. Because it was her who drives me to the Church of the Saviour (*translator note: a church in Beijing*) every time, and then I would have to change to your car to be able to get into the gated apartment complex. She thought I was always just at your place to play Mahjong or poker. We were always just transparent individuals in each others lives. Your wife was like the queen in The Legend of Zhen Huan (*translator note: a very popular show about royal drama in ancient China*), while words couldn't describe how embarrassed I felt.

There were so many times where I thought, am I still a human? I thought I was a soulless creature, faking, faking everyday, which one is the real me? I shouldn't have come to this world, but I don't have the courage to die.

I really want to just live simply, but things turned out different than what I wanted. On the 30th, we argued very badly. You said on the afternoon on the 2nd, we would go to your home to slowly talk it out. Today at noon, you called to say you are busy, denied everything, made excuse to say we would talk another day... and just like this, you disappeared again, just like seven years ago.

You played with me, and dumped me when you are done with me. You said there were no transactions between us. Yes, that is true, our affection towards each other had nothing to do with money or power. But I have a hard time finding closure for, and coming to terms with our three year long relationship. You were always scared I would secretly bring a recording device, and leave evidence. That's right, other than me, I do not have any evidence to prove what happened, no audio recording, no video taping. The only thing I have is memory from my own messed up self.

For someone as prominent as yourself, I know you said you are not afraid. But it doesn't matter if I'm hitting a rock with an egg, or being a moth that flies towards the flame, I am telling the truth about what happened between us. With your intelligence and wits I am sure you will either deny it, or blame it on me, or you could simply play it cool. You always say you hope your mother in heaven could bless you. I am a bad woman who doesn't deserve to be a mother, but you are a father with both boy and girl. I have asked you this before, would you have done the same even to your adopted daughter? Do you still have the courage to face your mother after what you have done in your lifetime? We sure all like to pretend we are virtuous...",1636039930

48,tennis,Who do you think will win the round of 16 match between Djokovic and Monfils?,"The [Djokovic vs. Monfils](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/atp-head-2-head/novak-djokovic-vs-gael-monfils/D643/MC65) 17-0 H2H is currently part of a 6-way tie for the most Open Era H2H wins in which the H2H leader has never lost to the other player in the H2H. They are tied with these 5 other 17-0 Open Era H2Hs: 

* [Borg vs. Gerulaitis (Borg leads 17-0)](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/atp-head-2-head/bjorn-borg-vs-vitas-gerulaitis/B058/G008)

* [Federer vs. Youzhny (Federer leads 17-0)](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/atp-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-mikhail-youzhny/F324/Y061)

If Djokovic beats Monfils, their rivalry would have the stand-alone Open Era record as the only 18-0 H2H. If Monfils beats Djokovic, he will end one of the 6 most dominant Open Era H2Hs in which only 1 player has ever won.

61,tennis,Zverev could move ahead of Tsitsipas to get the #3 spot in the regular ranking or even move ahead of Medvedev to get the #2 spot in the regular rankings depending on his Paris finish and Medvedev's Paris finish.,"Zverev can move ahead of Tsitsipas and get the #3 ranking by reaching the semifinals in Paris. Tsitsipas will drop 1300 points from 2019 Tour Finals and won't be able to gain any points from Paris Masters because the 10 points he gets from losing in the round of 32 are not among his 19 best countable results. So, after Paris, Tsitsipas will have 7840-1300=6540 points. Zverev will drop 400 points from 2019 Tour Finals and 600 points from 2020 Paris Masters. By reaching the semifinals he would gain 360 points for a total of 7180-400-600+360=6540. So, by reaching the semifinals, Zverev would be tied with Tsitsipas at 6540 points. Zverev would be ranked ahead of Tsitsipas in this tie scenario because he would have more points from Tour Finals, mandatory Masters (note: Monte-Carlo Masters is not a mandatory Masters), and Grand Slams (Zverev would have 5160 points from these tournaments while Tsitsipas would have 3570).

&amp;#x200B;

Zverev could also move ahead of Medvedev to get the #2 ranking if he wins the Paris title and Medvedev does not reach the quarterfinals. In this scenario, Zverev would have the 6540 points from the scenario in the first paragraph plus an additional 640 points for winning the title. So, he would have 6540+640=7180 points. Medvedev will drop 1000 points from 2020 Paris Masters and 1500 points from 2020 Tour Finals and gain 90 points for losing in the round of 16 for a total of 9540-1000-1500+90=7130 points, which would be less than Zverev's 7180 points.",1635973695

78,tennis,I am honestly tired of watching Tennis,"Pick any player from the next gen. Their best chance at winning anything is only when their opponent's tennis skills are ersatz. The moment someone steps up their game, any next gen players simply fumbles and falls apart. They do not know how to adapt, how to counter, how to step up. 

I find these ""best backhand on the tour"" or ""best service on the tour"" polls laughable. 
The best backhand is not really the best backhand if you can't count on it when everything else is failing. The best service has to stay consistent even in clutch games.

It's literally a joke to watch these guys win a tournament only to show up next day and lose to someone who won't make it past the next round. 
I can't really pretend to enjoy this atrocity anymore. 

On that note, I am glad I got to live in the era of the big three.

He has been struggling with injury since 2017. Its been 4 full years and zero adaption. His second serve is still terrible, no extra pace on the first serve, forehand is way too slow, rarely go aggressive with backhand. The worst part is its all possible, he did it in 2012/13. At some points he was more aggressive than Federer.

25,tennis,[Q] M. Giron d. F. Tiafoe 6-7 6-4 6-3,"Tiafoe had a double break in the first set, but after playing some poor service games, he squandered his two game lead. Fortunately, he managed to play a good tiebreaker to take the set. Even though he had more winners than Giron in the second set, he played a bad service game to surrender his serve. Giron was solid enough on serve to close out the set. In the third set he had more opportunities to break but wasn't able to take his chances, and after playing another poor service game, Giron broke his serve to take the lead. Tiafoe couldn't even hold his serve to make Giron serve out the match.

 In the end, Tiafoe made too many errors in the important moments and was too inconsistent on his service games. After having such a good tournament last week, this is a real let down from him. I'm beginning to think that Taylor Fritz is the more consistent player, and I think at this point, we can expect more from him. Tiafoe will need to work hard in the off-season because this was a match he shouldn't have lost.",1635893450

27,tennis,Tsitsipas is out of contention for Year-End Number 1 after Djokovic won his round of 32 match at the Paris Masters + YE #1 scenarios in Paris,"Tsitsipas is currently at 5695 points in the [official Race to Turin rankings](https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles-race-to-turin) which are being used to determine YE #1 this year. If he wins the maximum 2695 possible points in the remainder of the season (990 from Paris \[subtracted 10 points from Wimbledon which become non-coutable\], 205 from Stockholm \[subtracted 45 points from Vienna or Marseille which become non-countable\], and 1500 from Tour Finals) he will finish with 8390 points. Djokovic is guaranteed to finish with at least 8460 points (added the 90 points he will gain from reaching the round of 16 in Paris to his current official total of 8370 points), so Tsitsipas can no longer overtake him. Before Djokovic's win today, it was possible for Tsitsipas to overtake Djokovic because Djokovic would have been guaranteed to finish with at least 8380 points (added in the 10 points Djokovic would have gotten for losing in the round of 32 in Paris), which was less than Tsitsipas's maximum of 8390 points.

&amp;#x200B;

Medvedev and Djokovic are the only players remaining in contention for YE #1. Below are the scenarios in which Djokovic could clinch YE #1 in Paris.

If Medvedev takes a wildcard into Stockholm (unlikely but possible):

* Medvedev does not reach Paris semifinal (regardless of Djokovic's upcoming Paris results)
* Djokovic reaches Paris quarterfinal and Medvedev does not reach Paris semifinal
* Djokovic reaches Paris semifinal and Medvedev does not reach Paris final
* Djokovic reaches Paris final and Medvedev does not win Paris title
* Djokovic wins Paris title (regardless of Medvedev's upcoming Paris results)

If Medvedev does not play Stockholm (likely):

* Medvedev does not reach Paris final (regardless of Djokovic's upcoming Paris results)
* Djokovic reaches Paris semifinal and Medvedev does not win Paris title
* Djokovic reaches Paris final (regardless of Medvedev's upcoming Paris results)",1635892124

73,tennis,Are baseline drop shots ineffective on the ATP tour? Some stats analysis,"TL;DR:

* the men don't really end points with them
* it's almost random whether drop shots help them win points overall
* Djokovic has a pretty meh drop shot
* they may be declining in effectiveness among top players

Prompted by Murray's horror show with his (as usual) awful drop shots last night, I got thinking about how bad they are as a point winning tactic on the men's tour.

I got to looking at some stats and [this](https://tennisabstract.com/reports/mcp_leaders_tactics_men_last52.html) is pretty interesting, a breakdown of the current ATP tour's shot selection and success over the past 52 weeks. There are 44 players here and **only 12 players have a winner/error-forcing rate of over 40%** for drop shots from the baseline**.**

Of these players, Alcaraz, Gasquet and Federer have a high success rate AND frequency of drop shot, and only those 3 and Thiem, PCB and Nadal use the drop shot more than 1% of the time. Bublik, Sonego, ADF, Murray and Evans all stick out as players who use them lots without success. Djokovic is meh too.

Obviously drop shots don't just work by winning a point immediately; they may force the opponent to pop up the ball for an easy volley for you. I struggled to find the stats for all the players, but the site suggests that (across all years; te[nnisabstract.com](https://Tennisabstract.com) has charted 4954 matches by 798 players, including 347 who aren't active) **the tour average for points won where a drop shot was played is 55%** (using inptsw% [here](http://www.tennisabstract.com/charting/20150712-M-Wimbledon-F-Roger_Federer-Novak_Djokovic.html))

Here are the drop shop points win %s for the current top 10 though (Federer's is 62%, btw): 

1. **Djokovic: 52%**
2. **Medvedev: 48%**
3. **Tsitsipas: 49%**
4. **Zverev: 52%**
5. Nadal: 62%
6. **Rublev: 50%**
7. Berrettini: 55%
8. Ruud: 62%
9. **Sinner: 50%**
10. **Hurkacz: 46%**

Basically, most of the current top 10 are actually worse than the historical average success rate. Maybe the entire ATP tour is struggling more with them now than before, or the top 10 simply don't really need a good drop shot in their arsenal nowadays. Medvedev and Tsitsipas actually lose more points than they win with them!",1635855778

Can‚Äôt say I blame him, he‚Äôs already made enough of an impact at senior level it doesn‚Äôt make much sense for him to do this.

Juan Manuel Cerundolo replaces him- a 19 year old Argentinian ranked 85, who has played almost exclusively on clay this year (with the sole exception being 1R Wimbledon qualifying- did not even bother to play US open qualifying and was not ranked high enough to play Aus qualies). He might be in for a bit of a shock on the fast hard courts of Milan. His game is tailor made for clay, and predicated on a crafty lefty game with high margins, good defense, and lots of topspin. At least he‚Äôll get $80k as a participation fee. 

With Sinner‚Äôs participation very much in doubt due to still being in contention for Turin (may choose to play Stockholm instead for points, plus he already won it), we may end up with Sebastian Baez who is next in line, and is another Argentinian claycourter, although Hugo Gaston and Holger Rune are in with a real shot if they do well enough this week. Personally I hope one of the latter 2 makes it.

Do you think having 2 random dirtballers at the NextGen finals devalues it somewhat?",1635814784

22,tennis,Tennis in the UK and Weather,"I recently took up tennis as a new hobby as I wanted to do an outdoor racquet sport. I didn't want to do a seasonal sport and bring out my racquet or practice only once a year. We are at the time of the year when it gets dark early and there is a constant risk of rain. I'd be surprised if proper tennis players and enthusiasts actually give up their sport after the summer and early autumn months. I certainly don't want to do this. In the UK, the weather could potentially be unsettled for up to 5 months. 

I might be stating the obvious here as this goes for all outdoor sports, but how do tennis enthusiasts in the UK maintain their game and manage court bookings. Is it it constant issue and you have to deal with multiple cancellations and potential waste of money? Tennis is obviously a popular sport in the UK so I'm wondering how people here manage this.

Personally I don't mind playing in drizzle, wearing a light jacket etc. The wet ground however is the issue. I have still to buy proper tennis shoes as I'm still wearing running trainers. Maybe tennis shoes would provide better traction in rain.",1635792441

I thought it would be fun to do a follow-up. This is the fourth and final part in the series, on new names to watch out for or on player who've already broken through, to some extent, that were missed out on last year's list.

* Part I: [ATP players from the 2020 list](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q0koy8/some_young_players_you_should_know_about_2020/);
* Part II: [new youngsters to look out for in the men's game](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q6gx9k/some_young_players_you_should_know_about_part_ii/);
* Part III: [WTA players from the 2020 list](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/qc6r3f/some_young_players_you_should_know_about_2020/).

In this final part, it's time to add some new names to the WTA list: bright young stars who perhaps were overlooked last year, or those who are just arriving and worth looking out for in future.

As before, ranking info is provided for each player, this time just their rankings (and junior rankings, if appropriate) on the most recent list (November 1st), along with age (in format years.months) and country. Everyone on this list is under 20 at the time of posting.

I begin with a couple of players who've already made something of a name for themselves. Truth be told, though, that many of the breakthrough young stars have already been included on the 2020 list! Despite that, there are a couple that are worth mentioning:

**Marta Kostyuk** (Ukraine; 19.4; 50): It's almost a surprise that Kostyuk didn't make last year's list, as she was surely among the most successful juniors and was threatening the Top 100 last year. Her junior record was remarkable, winning the Junior Orange Bowl in 2015, Les Petits As in 2016, the AusOpen in 2017 aged 14, and quitting junior tennis altogether shortly after turning 15 to play exclusively on the adult tour. Her first ITF tournament win also came before her 15th birthday, and her second came in 2018, taking her to the verge of the Top 100. In 2019, however, she slipped back, losing ranking points and failing to win any more titles, although a few decent runs kept her in the Top 150. A third ITF title came in 2020. No more titles since then, but this season has seen Kostyuk climb all the way to 51st, in large part due to deep runs at Abu Dhabi, Istanbul, and the French Open (reaching the fourth round after beating Muguruza), and last week at Cluj where she made the SF. Whilst Kostyuk is still waiting for her maiden Tour-level title, there's still no doubt that she's amongst the most promising young players. See also [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/p0fayd/next_gen_of_the_week_7_marta_kostyuk/) by u/lostinmoss.

**Caty McNally** (USA; 19.11; 145): McNally makes it onto this list primarily for her doubles career, which consists so far of ten titles at all levels (four at Tour level), as well as two AusOpen QFs and the 2021 US Open final alongside CoCo Gauff, all of which has given her a Doubles ranking of 21st. Her Singles career has been less prolific, with two ITF titles to her name, the most recent of which came two years ago, and she's not yet been able to match or improve upon her 2019 career-high ranking of 105th. Still, if McNally can continue her success at doubles that would also justify conclusion on this list. Playing in Midland this week.

Also, a brief shout-out to **Amanda Anisimova**, who only misses out a fuller entry by virtue of having turned 20 in August. The horrible tragedy of her father's sudden death two years ago has clearly affected her; signs at Indian Wells were that she was back to enjoying tennis again, and here's hoping that she can rediscover her earlier form.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Now to players to look out for in the next couple of years. These first names are the ones I'm most keen to write about, but of course this is very up in the air, so who knows if I've made the right picks? Ideally they've shown success at junior *and* adult/ITF level. Anyway, let's crack on.

**Zheng Qinwen** (China; 19.1; 147): The third under-21 Chinese player in the Top 150, behind Xiyu and Xinyu Wang, and coming of course from the same generation as such players as Kostyuk, Tauson, Raducanu, and Osorio Serrano, all of whom she met at some point in her junior days. Kostyuk thrashed her, but then again Kostyuk was thrashing most juniors! Zheng made the Junior Orange Bowl final in 2016, and the Orange Bowl finals proper in 2018, losing to Gauff on the latter occasion. So, a promising junior but behind many of the bigger names. On the other hand, her performance at ITFs has been pretty decent, especially post-pandemic. After the August 2020 restart, she won four tournaments at the end of 2020, and her first in 2021. Like most Chinese players, continued Covid restrictions have affected her 2021 season, but she returned in May-June, and then in September. One more tournament win, and a couple of decent runs elsewhere, have lifted her to the Top 150. Assuming she carries on, next season is likely to see her enter WTA250s with more regularity. Playing in Nantes this week.

**Linda Noskov√°** (Czechia; 16.11; 315; J14): The Fruhvirtova sisters are just two of several young Czech girls that are seriously promising tennis stars. There are six under-18 Czechs in the WTA Top 1000, and Brenda Fruhvirtova isn't even ranked yet. Noskova is the highest of them, and also the second-highest under-18 in the rankings, behind Gauff. Some way behind Gauff, to be sure, but then again that's because CoCo is exceptional. Noskova herself isn't too bad, either. Her first notable result is being the losing finalist to Eala in the 2018 Petits As, in an extremely tight match. Her junior career includes four titles, the biggest being the 2021 French Open. On the ITF main tour, she's picked up three titles this year so far, with other consistent results helping her to zoom up the rankings to 315th, having been outside the Top 1000 at the start of 2021. Look out for her in 2022 as she seeks to build on that.

**Antonia Ru≈æiƒá** (Croatia; 18.9; 355): The 2021 European Junior Champion, and winner of three ITF titles since August, that sent her ranking up 400 places. The first of two Croatians on this list, although I'm not sure if she's just tapped into a hot run of form or if this is indicative of something more promising. Nevertheless, at that Junior tournament, she beat Linda Fruhvirtova and Elsa Jacquemot, two other top juniors, and her performance at her last tournament included a first Top-100 win, so she deserves to be regarded as part of the conversation of NextGen stars, even if she ends up being a later bloomer than others in this generation.

**Sara Bejlek** (Czechia; 15.9; 375; J63): The second Czech in this list, Bejlek is also the second-youngest player in the Top 1000. Mainly due to her victory at an ITF 60k, but she's (obviously) not played much Adult-level tennis yet, and it's not like she's losing every other match she's playing: four other QF runs at ITF tournaments. Will probably have at least one more season of mixing Junior and ITF events, so definitely one to look out for in the coming couple of seasons. My feeling is that 2022 will still be too early to expect much, but I'm intrigued by her potential.

**Matilda Mutavdzic** (UK; 17.4; 448; J33): I have been in two minds about whether to mention Matilda or not. I was swayed ultimately by her performance in Netanya two weeks ago, where she beat Linda Noskova in three sets on her way to a second ITF final of the year. The young Brit is taking a more traditional route through tennis, currently mixing in ITF tournaments with juniors. Her most notable results include the Gold Medal at the European Youth Olympics 2019 and a first ITF title in 2020. Still looking for a breakout result, but solid progress up the rankings, especially in the last month or so, and plenty of time to improve further still.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Now, some honourable mentions. Players on this are either too young to be so easily noticed at the top level for some years, or haven't had success at top-level tournaments but are still probably worth keeping an eye on regardless.

**Elsa Jacquemot** (France; 18.5; 310; J7): The 2020 French Open Junior Champion, this year marks her first serious full year of touring. As with some top juniors it's been a difficult transition, but last week she reached the SF in the Poitiers W80, recording a second win over a Top-100 player and lifting her into the Top 350 for the first time. After doing the hard yards over the last couple of years, Jacquemot may be ready to make a step up next season.

**Nikola Bart≈Ø≈àkov√°**  (Czechia; 15.8; 780; J32): Youngest player in the Top 1000, and yet another young Czech star, but without so many eye-catching results just yet. Won a high-level Junior tournament last month. As an aside, it's seriously exciting to see so many young Czech girls having potential to be future stars, and follow in the footsteps of such recent stars as the Pliskova sisters and Kvitova!

**Petra Marƒçinko** (Croatia; 15.11; 902; J8): The second Croatian on this list, Marcinko is the third and final under-16 player in the Top 1000. Enjoyed a particularly brilliant 2019, winning five of her seven Junior tournaments, and recently made the US Open Girls' Singles QF. Last week, won the Singles and Doubles titles at the JA Cape Town tournament, one of the top junior tournaments outside the slams, beating Brenda Fruhvirtova in the doubles final. Started playing ITF events this year, with two SF and two QF runs.

**Clervie Ngounoue** (USA; 15.3; J24): 2018 U12 Orange Bowl Champion, and finalist at the 2017 U12/2019 U16 Orange Bow, 2020 Petits As, 2021 JA Milan and JA Cape Town. Has lost a combined six times to the Fruhvirtova sisters, often in high-profile Junior finals, and has a 2-2 rivalry going with Marcinko (losing to her last week). Despite this unenviable record against other top juniors, is one of the most promising US Juniors out there. Has played only a couple of adult-level tournaments so far, with a couple of match wins already.

**Daria Egorova** (Russia; 14.4; J427): Way too early to know where Egorova's future is going, but has made an eye-catching start to her junior career, winning four straight tournaments and 29 of her first 31 junior-level matches. Yet to face any top juniors, and so far only playing in Eastern Europe, but look out for her in a couple of years or so.

**Hannah Klugman** (UK; 12; N/A): An even longer shot, but a 12-year-old Klugman's already winning matches at high levels, reaching the 2021 Petits As under-14 semis, and beating all-comers in an adult-level British Tour event in May, as well as generally tearing it up in junior British tennis.

Finally, a few names I would like to mention in passing: **Reese Brantmeier**, who had a decent chance at qualifying for the US Open this year; **Katie Volynets**, one of the top US Juniors whose name is made for tennis; **Erika Andreeva**, losing finalist at the 2021 French Open, and with three ITF titles, who is set to be the highest-ranked under-18 not yet mentioned on this list or the last one; and **Mirra Andreeva**, another 14-year-old prodigy and Erika's younger sister, who won the 2019 U12 Orange Bowl and may well feature more prominently on next year's list. Brantmeier and Volynets are also playing in Midland this week (Brantmeier facing McNally in the first round).

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

That concludes this year's list. Hope you enjoyed it! I will try to be around next year to follow-up on the names mentioned above. With any luck, some of them will have gained wider attention by then, as well as the players in the 2020 list who are still on the rise. I should also say that there are currently 46 teenagers in the Top 500, and over this post and the last one I've covered not quite half of them, so there's an enormous depth of potential new talent out there.

After Simona Halep exited the top 10 this past summer and broke her own 7-year long streak, of the current top 10 players as of October 25, 2021, Svitolina owned the longest consecutive streak and held it until she officially exited as of today. This marks 234 consecutive weeks total. She was ranked #6 during her last week in the top echelon and is now ranked #14. 

Why the drop? 1080 points are dropping from being the WTA Finals runner-up in 2019 against Barty, none of which she can defend. Despite having a relatively consistent W-L ratio this year, she did not make it deep enough in the high-stakes tournaments she played in like she did from 2017-2019. A further 390 points will drop next week from making the semifinals at Indian Wells in 2019, likely taking her to \~#15 for her year-end rating, which would be her lowest in 6 years. She will, thus, have the lowest seed she's had at her next Slam since 2016.

Since her momentous rise to the top 10, she has won 9 titles out of 10 final appearances, including Rome 2017, Rogers Cup-Toronto 2017, Rome 2018, and the WTA Finals in 2018. She also made two Slam semifinals in 2019: Wimbledon and the US Open. 

Who now holds the longest consecutive streak? Barty - April 1, 2019.",1635758054

It seems like every other comment regarding Tiafoe is negative. A 50/50 split between people who like his antics, I love them, and the other half thinking he's bad for the sport cause they're annoyed that their player (Sinner-fan-boys I'm talking to you) lost etc.

One of the legends of the sport, John McEnroe, would make Tiafoe's antics look like kid's play. Heck, even Kyrgios makes Tiafoe's antics feel like soft play, which in all fairness it is, he interacts with the audience, fires them up, gets them on his side in the process.

Doesn't tennis need more characters like Tiafoe that bring some excitement and mental-flare tonthe matches? Wouldn't it make watching tennis both in the stadium and on TV if there were more players like that?",1635745725

In 2021, that tournament is the Stockholm Open. The Stockholm Open ends on Saturday, November 13th. The Nitto ATP Finals start the next day on Sunday, November 14th. So, the Nitto ATP Finals start before the Monday after the last ATP Tour tournament of the calendar year. How will qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals be determined if the Nitto ATP Finals start before the Monday when the Race to Turin rankings used for determining qualification is released? Will the ATP release the Race to Turin rankings a day earlier on Sunday, November 14th or will it use so-called ""live rankings""?",1635719698

I got a high-end electric blower for about $200 and use it to clean off public courts that aren't washed before playing.  It's not just about the leaves, but the dirt and dust.

With clean courts, new balls stay perky for the entire 2-3 hour hitting session instead of dying after 30 minutes.  I never knew how much this was effecting my game.

Shoes get better and more reliable traction.

You dont end up with a dust cloud coming off the ball, straight in your face, every time you make contact.  Way better for the lungs, allergies, and just pleasantness.  I feel noticeably cleaner after playing without all that dust coating me.

I know it doesnt look the coolest, but taking 10 minutes to blow off the court is a total game changer.",1635717475

We've started running Fantasy brackets &amp; leagues within the app and I'd love to get an r/tennis league created as another fun way for everyone here to connect + test their tennis knowledge against each other every week.

The leagues generate their own picks summaries and leaderboards, so we could definitely post them here as well and see amongst r/tennis fantasy players:

* Who the most popular picks were to win, make the final, win each quarter for each tournament (we'd post after picks close, so when the first round starts)
* Who won the brackets, won the week overall and who's leading the full season leaderboards

We're running a competition this week for the ATP1000 in Paris and would love to get an r/tennis competition running for it. If you're interested you can join the r/tennis league now by:

* [Downloading the app here](http://tnnslive.com/download)
* Going to the Fantasy tab, open Browse Leagues and scroll down to the 'r/tennis' league
* Tap 'Join League'
* Go back to the Fantasy home screen and make your picks for Paris

Picks can be changed all the way up until the first serve in the first main draw match, so you can come back later and make changes once all the qualifiers are known.

Would love to bring the r/tennis community in there but no dramas if it doesn't interest you :)

And with Fantasy + anything else in the app - anytime if there's something you'd like to see added or you're not enjoying - send me a PM and we'll take a look!",1635709449

18,tennis,Why don't tennis tourneys tie fans hands together and put tape on their mouths?,"After that disgraceful disrespectful act by tiafoe vs Vatican endorsed puritan sinner, why should tennis allow fans to ever engage with the sport? We have seen it numerous times in the past with the crowd during the Federer Djokovic wimbledon 2019 final with the disgusting finger wagging motion as well with the repeated cheers of double faults that emotionally and physically cripple these multimillionaire players. 

If we want to maintain the sanctity and purity of tennis, fans should NOT be able to interact with the players/games. We can't simply ask them to behave according to tennis's commandments..we must restrict it. I propose that all fans where binds on their hands and have tight clamps/tapes placed on their mouths so they know NOT to make any audible noises that may disturb players at any time.

I also think we NEED to worry about player safety similar.to the NFL..all players should wear pillows around their chests/ nether regions to prevent any accidents with the balls.",1635695692

51,tennis,Unpopular opinion for this sub: Tiafoe is absolutely over the top on the court and Sinner was somewhat in the right,"I will preface this by saying that I think Tiafoe is a great guy who is clearly well-liked by most guys on the tour and I really respect that he enjoys himself on the court and wants to have fun. I am also an American and enjoy cheering for players from my country.

All that being said, I agree with Sinner and some non-Redditors that Tiafoe is over the top on the court, which is something that I've thought for a while. The strutting around, staring down his opponent, acting like he is about to collapse after every point then somehow finding energy, posing after every good shot he hits, etc. is honestly a bit much. Now, I want to clarify that I do not think that what is is doing is at all against the rules, and it is probably good for tennis in that it involves the crowd. My only point is that Sinner and potentially other players have the right to be annoyed with Tiafoe on the court.

Again, I want to reiterate that Tiafoe is not a bad person nor does he deserve punishment; I just kind of agree with Sinner here. I know that I'm going to get accused of being against fun in tennis or whatever, but I'm honestly not. I love watching Kyrgios, Monfils, and other guys who love to involve the crowd, but there's something about Tiafoe's behavior in particular on the court that is just too much.",1635632672

Here is an image of it: [https://imgur.com/Jb4G0ih](https://imgur.com/Jb4G0ih). I have emailed the ATP to ask about this inconsistency. In the meantime, I will assume that Djokovic would earn 10 points for losing in the round of 32 of Paris Masters since that is what the ATP has been doing in practice. So, with this logic, Djokovic needs to win his round of 32 match against Fognini or Fuscovics for Tsitsipas to be out of contention for YE#1.",1635621210

83,tennis,Next Gen of the Week #9: Coco Gauff,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/pc0hto/next_gen_of_the_week_8_mikael_ymer/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

It's time for the last WTA player of the year in this series. I was planning one more originally, but this seems like a more fitting end, and I waited way too long between writing these. So without further ado, let's talk about the rising American, Coco Gauff.

- Age: 17
- Ranking: 22 (Race Ranking of 17)
- Notable Results: RG QF, 1000 SF, 2x 250 W
- Notable Wins: Osaka, Sabalenka, Bertens 
- Strengths: Shotmaking, Athleticism, Variety
- Weaknesses: Forehand, Second Serve, Gameplan

Often when talking about great players, there is a quality that can't quite be described - even if you talk about every aspect of someone like Djokovic's game, you'll leave out the little miracles he produces. Gauff can create those miraculous shots. When she's on the run, sliding into a backhand, she rips it crosscourt onto the line. There's no describing that exactly. It isn't her usual play, but those moments are something we see from a lot of great players. She comes up with seemingly impossible shots under pressure, which is a difficult quality to teach.

Gauff's parents are former college athletes, so it's no surprise she's naturally athletic. Her speed and strength, especially for someone so young, are amazing. She covers the court incredibly well, and has the stability to make shots on the run without giving up power or accuracy. As she grows into her physical prime, this will only improve. The fact that she was already capable of handling tour level speed and weight of shot at 15 is a testament to just how crazy her physical prowess is. 

If you've followed any of her doubles exploits, this next part won't come as a surprise. Gauff has great hands at the net, and uses that to her advantage in singles. While her primary style involves trading from the baseline, she's unafraid to approach the net to finish off a point or just to mix up an opponent. With her level of power, this sets her up for a lot of free points where she can simply go for a strong shot down the line and clean up the resulting putaway. While it isn't a primary focus of her game, it adds another dimension that will be necessary as she progresses.

Despite her natural power, she hasn't quite channeled it into her forehand. Her current technique involves a larger wind up that often results in her getting rushed on faster courts. Even when she has time, she still leaves the ball short in the court fairly often, giving opponents an opportunity to put her on defense. To utilize her full skillset, she needs to be able to flatten out her forehand and use it as an offensive weapon, rather than letting it be passive. If she can fix this wing, it'll give her a much more solid game since opponents won't feel safe going to her forehand.

The next issue seems to be a common one for younger players nowadays: she double faults a lot. While she's certainly improved this year, she still seems to lack confidence in her second serve. While it isn't a crazy amount like some people, (cough Zverev cough), it certainly makes her service games significantly more unstable. Giving opponents a free point let's them know there's always a chance in any game - its confidence they don't have to earn that will always come back and bite you. Luckily, it seems to be improving and I have high hopes it'll mostly fade.

Her last problem is somewhat complicated. Currently, Gauff is in a weird stage where she has a lot of options of how to grow. Her athleticism makes her a great defender, her power makes her great at being an aggressive baseliner, and her variety can supplement anything. That puts her in the awkward space where she doesn't really have a good gameplan. Sometimes she's too passive and gives her opponents too many opportunities. Sometimes she's gets too aggressive on the forehand and throws out errors. Bringing it all together and figuring out what works best for her will be a challenge, especially as she continues to improve weaker aspects of her game. 

Gauff's age and constant improvement make her winning a slam almost a when, not an if. But she still has to actually do it. With no shortage of competition, nothing is a guarantee in the WTA. Whether she'll actually put the game together is an open question, but one I'm answering with yes.

2,tennis,Nadal fails to qualify for the Tour Finals for the 1st time since 2004,"Big thanks to 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, a distinction must be made between qualifying for Tour Finals and playing Tour Finals. Qualifying for Tour Finals means that a player met the criteria for playing Tour Finals, regardless of whether they actually played or not. One way to qualify for Tour Finals is being in the top seven in the Race rankings after the Paris Masters. Another way is being a current-year Grand Slam champion positioned between No. 8 and No. 20 in the Race. If there are two current-year Grand Slam champions positioned between No. 8 and No. 20 in the Race, the highest-placed of those players becomes the eighth and final qualifier. Another way to qualify  is being ranked 8th in the Race if there are no current-year Grand Slam champions positioned between No. 8 and No. 20. Playing Tour Finals means the player qualified for and then played Tour Finals. I am referring only to qualifying for Tour Finals.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are Nadal's finishes in the Race rankings every year he didn't play Tour Finals from 2005 to 2021. Years not mentioned are years in which he played it and therefore qualified.

&amp;#x200B;

2005 - #2

2008 - #1

2012 - #4

2014 - #3

2016 - #8

2018 - #2

***2021 - no higher than #9***

&amp;#x200B;

He finished in the top 7 in all the the years from 2005 to 2021 he did not play except 2016 and 2021. In 2016, he finished #8 but still qualified because there were no Grand Slam champions positioned between #8 and #20 in the Race that year. But in 2021, he will not qualify because he is now #9 in the Race and is out for the rest of the season, so he won't be able to gain more points. Therefore, he will not qualify for Tour Finals for the 1st time since 2004.",1635567948

4,tennis,"""He even saves the out shots to keep the ball in play. Classy.""","Just wanted to draw attention to this gem of a comment in the thread showing Nadal hitting with a 97 year old man.

Thread is here:
https://np.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/qikm57/comment/hijzk4l/

How classy of Nadal to not leave the balls going long while sparring with a freaking 97 year old at his academy. I bet the likes of Djokovic and Federer would've ducked out of the way of each ball going long, before nailing the old man with a Del Potro'esque forehand right at his 97 year old face. That would teach him to stand so close to the net and put so little weight on his shots. But not Nadal, he's just straight up classy!

How does someone post this and then get 200+ people to upvote it? Surely even if you've never picked up a racquet you'd know that nobody in the world would let the balls go long while having a gentle sparring session like this with anyone, let alone when you're one of the greatest ever and the other guy is a few years short of 100. Ahhh, that's enough Reddit for today",1635553917
5,tennis,Thrown out arm after serving?,"I threw my arm/shoulder out after serving too much a few years ago, and it hasn't been good ever since. The pain is localized to the front of the body, around the joint where the arm meets the shoulder.

I can go serving for maybe a set or so but then the pain comes in and I feel numb or loss of strength and then sharp pains after serving any longer and have to stop.

I hate it and know it's impacted my desire to play because I'm always scared of hurting myself more.

Has anyone else experienced this before? What has worked for y'all?",1635552032
6,tennis,Is this decent for a weekend warrior?,"So I've been organising some tennis matches with friends. None of us are great but you know, it's a good hobby.

Anyway, I'm borrowing my friend's racket which is like 30 years old and I'm thinking maybe I should buy one of my own.

Mind you - we're all in our mid-40s - at this stage, none of us are expecting any wildcard entries into Wimbledon at this stage - but we want to play as a weekend thing for fitness and we'd like to improve.

Is the Wilson Ultra Comp decent for a beginner? It's available at Costco and it's probably a little bit more expensive than your standard department store racket but it's not like so expensive that it would be hard to justify to the other half.

24,tennis,Theory: Tsitsipas is doing the minimum necessary to get YE #1.,"Tsitsipas can still technically be YE #1 if he wins Paris, Stockholm, and Tour Finals, Djokovic withdraws from Paris and Turin and doesn‚Äôt play another match this season, and Medvedev wins no more than 1919 points in the rest of the season. He would add 990 points by winning Paris (not 1000 because 10 points become non-countable), 205 points by winning Stockholm (not 250 because 45 points become non-countable), and 1500 points from Tour Finals for a total of 8390 points at the end of the season. That‚Äôs more than the 8370 points that Race leader Djokovic currently has. Had Tsitsipas lost 1 round earlier in Vienna, he‚Äôd have been out of contention.

Or if she notices the opponent tends to commit a lot of unforced errors, change the way you‚Äôre approaching the match.  A lot of these matches are short sets, no ad scoring.  Anyway, when she was practicing against a friend, the friend‚Äôs coach said to never change your playing style.  Don‚Äôt adjust to how you are playing based on the other person, always try to make your shot. 

I didn‚Äôt grow up playing tennis but I played ice hockey and I was always taught, if you knew someone‚Äôs weakness, exploit it.  Same thing in soccer.  If they‚Äôre weak on the left side of the pitch, you‚Äôre going to attack on that side.  Is this the same in tennis?  I know if you notice the person has a weak backhand, hit it to that side.

82,tennis,Modern Racquet Comp - Prince Spectrum Comp 90,"I have been playing tennis for a little over one year and really enjoy it. I originally bought a Wilson Burn that I got a great deal on and liked the racquet as it was all I was used to. I needed a backup racquet and ended up going to a used sports equipment store where I spent $20 on a Prince Spectrum Comp 90 series.

After hitting with this Prince racquet, which i learned was a 1985 model, I absolutely loved it. I feel so much control and spin with it. I typically play from the baseline, like to generate spin off both wings, and hit a fair amount of backhand slices. Overall, i feel like I hit just about every shot better with this racquet. I've done a research on new racquets and realized that virtually no, if any, new models offer this small head size and even the string pattern  (14x18) seems hard to find. 

For anyone who has been around the sport for a long time and has familiarity with racquets and how they have evolved over the last 35 years, are there aspects of this racquet that you think would point to an obvious choice for a new racquet for me?",1635448823

17,tennis,Ranking Roger Federer's tennis seasons (2000-2021)," 

Here is my ranking of Roger's tennis seasons (in my opinion). I have given each season a rating from F to S, however keep in mind that this is Roger Federer we are talking about, so all of these ratings are relative.

**22. 2020** \- Roger only played in one tournament this season, the Australian Open. Despite this, he made the semi-final, bowing out to the eventual winner Djokovic. He was shut out for the rest of the season due to Covid-19 concerns and surgery. *Rating:* **F**

**21. 2021** \- Roger's 2021 season consisted of 5 tournaments - Qatar, Geneva, Roland Garros, Halle and Wimbledon. His best result definitely came at Wimbledon, where he made the quarterfinal (becoming the oldest to do so at age 40). Unfortunately, Federer's season was also cut short by surgery, resulting in him not competing after Wimbledon. *Rating:* **F**

**20. 2000** \- This was Roger‚Äôs first impactful year on the tour. He competed in a total of 28 tournaments, however failed to win any and made 2 finals. Despite, this his consistency gave him a **55%** win rate, and beat 3 top 10 players. He also finished 4th in the Olympics, and made the 4th round of the French Open. *Rating:* **F**

**19. 2016 -** The injury season. Roger didn‚Äôt play for half of the season, due to a knee injury. Despite this, he still managed to make the semifinals of AO and Wimbledon, and made the finals of Brisbane International. Overall, Roger failed to pick up a title, and his win rate was **75%**, meaning that this season was one of his weaker ones. *Rating:* **F**

**18. 2001** \- Roger won his first ATP title (250 Milan) this season, as well as making 2 more finals. He got his best result in a grand slam so far, making the QFs of the French Open and Wimbledon. His win rate for this season was considerably higher, with a **70%** win rate. Notably, he upset world number 6 Pete Sampras at Wimbledon in the 4th round. *Rating:* **F**

**17. 2013** \- Another injury season. While Roger played throughout the whole season, a back injury meant that his form was significantly hampered. His best result in the slams was an AO semifinal, as he failed to get further than the QF in any other slam. Throughout the year he won just one tournament (250) and made 2 finals (1 M1000 and 1 500). His **73%** win rate was not exceptional, but he did manage to beat 4 top 10 players. *Rating:* **D**

**16. 2002 -** Federer‚Äôs first breakthrough. Federer‚Äôs performances in the Grand Slams were actually worse than the previous year (2 4th round appearances). However, his Masters title at Hamburg and his 3 total titles (1 M1000, 1 500, 1 250) makes up for this. At the Miami Open, he got his first win over a top ranked player (Lleyton Hewitt). He also accumulated 10 top 10 wins, and finished the year with a win rate of **71%**. *Rating:* **D**

**15. 2011** \- A great clay season. While many remember Djokovic for the 2011 season, it would be a disservice to Roger to suggest that his season was unsuccessful. He made at least the QFs in every slam, an achievement he‚Äôs only done in 8 seasons. Additionally, he made the FO final, beating peak Djokovic in the semis. Federer won 4 titles this season (1 M1000, 1 500, 1 250, 1 WTF), including a surprise Tour Finals win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (denying favourite Djokovic the title). His match win rate was a very respectable **84%,** and he beat 10 top 10 players throughout the year. *Rating:* **D**

**14. 2019 -** A year of ‚Äòalmosts‚Äô. Roger Federer‚Äôs 2019 season could have been even greater, however despite some squandered match points, he still managed to compete well. In the Slams, he got varying results, from 4R to a finals appearance (at Wimbledon). His semi-final appearance at the French Open represented a very respectable run on clay. Federer also won his 28th Masters Title, at Miami Open. In total, Federer picked up 4 titles (1 M1000, 3 500s), and reached 2 more finals (1 GS, 1 M1000). He ended the season with an **84%** win rate, which included 7 wins over top 10 players. *Rating:* **C**

**13. 2014 -** Comeback #1. After a poor 2013 season, an appointment of Stefan Edberg as co-coach with Severen Luthi seemed to be the catalyst to a Fed resurgence. He made 3 slam semi finals and 1 final (Wimbledon), a considerably better performance than the previous year. He won 5 tournaments (2 M1000s, 2 500s, 1 250), in addition to leading the Swiss team to their first ever Davis Cup victory. In the masters 1000s, he made a total of 5 finals, the highest in his career. He also made the final of the tour finals, however withdrew due to injury. He beat 1 top ranked player (Novak Djokovic) and 17 top 10 players, finishing with a very solid win rate of **86%** (the highest in the list so far). *Rating:* **C**

**12. 2015 -** The finals season. Federer had a respectable run in the slams, making 2 finals (wimbledon and uso). Unfortunately for him, this season was dominated by Djokovic, so Federer would have to settle for runner up on many occasion. He did manage to win the Cincinnati Masters, and 6 total titles (1 M1000, 3 500s, 2 250s). However, he also made 2 more Masters finals and the final of the Year End Championship. He finished the season with a solid win rate of **85%**, which included 3 wins of the man of the year, Djokovic. He also took down 15 top 10 players throughout the season, including the likes of Nadal and Murray.  He finished the season world number 3, which makes this season the best non-slam season of his life. *Rating:* **C**

**11. 2008 -** The loser of the greatest match of all time. Roger Federer‚Äôs 2008 season was extremely consistent, however Nadal‚Äôs level this year was ridiculous. In the Grand Slams, Federer completed a very impressive achievement of making the semi-final of every grand slam, and three finals. He has only done this on 4 occasions in his entire career. In the final of Wimbledon, Federer and Nadal had an absolute slugfest, where either player was completely deserving of the win. So despite only winning one grand slam, Federer was inches away from winning a second. Federer won 4 titles in the season (1 GS, 3 250s) and made 8 finals. Additionally, Federer only ever lost to Nadal in finals. Federer picked up 7 wins over top 10 players. He picked up a reasonable win rate of **81%**. *Rating:* **C** 

**10. 2018** \- The 20th slam season. In the slams, Federer started strongly with a win at AO. After intentionally missing Roland Garros, Federer bowed out in the QF of Wimbledon and the 4th Round of USO. In Masters 1000s, Federer failed to win any titles, however he made 2 finals and 4 semifinals overall. He picked up 4 titles (1 GS, 2 500s, 1 250). His year ended with an **83%** win rate, which involved beating 5 top 10 players. *Rating:* **B**

**9. 2003** \- The inaugural grand slam season. 2003 saw a solid improvement in Federer‚Äôs game from 2002. He won his first grand slam (Wimbledon, although you already knew that), and made 9 ATP tour finals, winning 7 of them (1 GS, 2 500s, 3 250s, 1 YEC). He also won the Year End Championship for the first time, beating world number 1 Andy Roddick en route to the final. Federer claimed 9 wins over top 10 players, ending the season with a win rate of **82%**. *Rating:* **A**

**8. 2010** \- Federer‚Äôs 2010 season followed saw a dip in consistency in the middle of the year (summer hard court, clay court), however overall, he had an notable presence on the tour. He won the Australian Open, and made at least the QF of all of the other slams. He won 5 titles (1 GS, 1 M100, 1 500, 1 250, 1 YEC), interestingly at each level of the tour. This included a Year End Championship title which involved beating world number 1 Rafa Nadal. Federer picked up 16 wins over top 10 players, an ended the year with a decent win rate of **83%.** *Rating:* **B**

**7. 2012 -** A surge season. Roger‚Äôs performance in the slams was the strongest in the list so far, with a win in Wimbledon, 3 SF appearances and 4 quarterfinal appearances. He also played in 10 finals, winning 6 of them (1 GS, 3 M1000s, 2 500s). He finished the year with a win rate of **86%**, which involved beating 16 top 10 players, including world number 1 Djokovic. *Rating:* **A**

**6. 2017** \- The biggest comeback of his career. Federer‚Äôs 2017 season was incredible, as it marked a total resurgence after the injury plagued 2016 season. He only competed in 3 slams (skipped RG), winning 2 of them (AO, WIM) and making a 3rd QF. He won 7 titles (2 GS, 3 M1000s, 2 500s), and competed in 8 finals (losing in the Canadian Open to Zverev). He finished the season with an incredible win rate of **92%**, the 4th highest in his career. Federer took down 14 top 10 players, including world number 1 Rafael Nadal. *Rating:* **A**

**5. 2009 -** The channel slam. One of Federer‚Äôs greatest achievements was finally reached this year, as he won the French Open to complete the career grand slam (one of each grand slam titles). After losing to Nadal in 3 consecutive Roland Garros finals leading up to this, it must have been a huge relief for Federer to hear that Robin Soderling upset Nadal in the 2nd round. Federer had an unbelievable run in the slams this season, making all 4 finals (only one of 5 men to do this in the open era), and winning 2 of them (RG, WIM). He won 4 titles (2 GS, 2 M1000s), and made 3 more finals. Federer accumulated a reasonable win rate of **84%**, but he managed to take down 15 top 10 players, including world number 1 Rafael Nadal (to finish year end number 1 for the fifth time in his career). *Rating:* **A**

**4. 2005 -** The beast season. Federer had an exceptional 2005 season, making all 4 grand slam semifinals, and going on to win 2 of them (WIM, USO). Additionally, Federer won a whopping 4 Masters 1000 titles, and an incredible **11 titles** overall (2 GS, 4 M1000s, 2 500s, 3 250s). He finished the season with a mouthwatering **95%** win rate, the joint highest of his career (one of the highest out of any players season ever). Federer took down 15 top 10 players, and beat world number 2 Lleyton Hewitt twice, finishing world number 1. *Rating:* **S**

**3. 2007 -** The hardcourt season. Roger‚Äôs performances in the slams this season were the joint-greatest in his career. He won 3 slams, and made the final of Roland Garros, losing to Nadal. He won the Year End Championship for the 4th time, as well as 2 Masters (making a total of 5 Masters finals). Overall, his title count was **8** (3 GS, 1 YEC, 2 M1000s, 1 500, 1 250). Federer had a win rate of **88%,** but 4 of his 9 losses that season came in finals.  Roger beat **17** top 10 players, including world number 2 Rafa Nadal 3 times. *Rating:* **S**

**2. 2004** \- The season that introduced the world to Roger Federer. This was the first of Federer's three slam seasons (AO, WIM, USO), with his only defeat coming at the 3rd round of the French Open. Federer also won 3 Masters, and the Year end Championship, to take his total title tally to **11!** (3 GS, 1 YEC, 3 M1000s, 1 500, 3 250s). Federer put together a ridiculous win rate of **93%**, have lost just 6 matches in the entire year. He finished comfortably as world number 1, having defeated **18** top 10 players, including world number 2 Andy Roddick 3 times. *Rating:* **S**

**1.** **2006** \- The greatest season of all time (in my opinion). Roger's 2006 tennis season was nearly perfect. In the grand slams, he won 3 and made the final of the French Open for the first time, losing to Nadal in 4 sets. Federer won 4 Masters titles, making another 2 finals, and brought home the Year End Championship. His total title count for this season was a tremendous **12** titles, with a ludicrous **16** finals! Of course, the statistic that stands far and above the rest is Roger's insane win-loss ratio: **92-5 (95% win rate)**. Of these 5 losses, 4 came at the hands of Nadal (3 of those being in clay finals). The only tournament that Roger failed to make the final of was the Cincinnati Masters, where he lost to an inspired Andy Murray in two close sets. There is really no way I can truly wrap my head around this season, Federer was easily the best grass and hard court player, and dominated the clay courts, losing only to the greatest clay courter ever. *Rating:* **S**",1635409846

21,tennis,Observation on Nadal's game.,"Nadal, one of the undisputed GOATs and tied grand-slam-record-holder, has arguably one of the best forehands of all time. When you think of Nadal, you would probably first think of his legendary fighting spirit and unrelenting playstyle. 

However, I've literally never heard a single person talk about Nadal's backhand, and only criticisms of Nadal's serve. I find it interesting how two out of three core shots in his game are largely unremarkable. 

However I feel like his backhand at least has to be better than 95% of the field, given his monumental success. Is his backhand a highly underrated, slept-on shot, or is it really all on his forehand and playstyle?",1635401580

Great Britain is one of only a few teams that only have 4 players in their Davis Cup team instead of five.

Monfils is also playing pretty good recently. He reached the final of Sofia. The French Davis Cup Captain Grosjean however didn't nominate Monfils and justified his decision by saying that he wanted to create the perfect mix of young and old players. He however nominated Gasquet instead who has the same age as Monfils. Grosjean apparently thinks Gasquet is much better than Monfils. I don't think so. What do you guys think?",1635367963

So my question is: if a player plays more than these 18 or 19 tournaments, are those tournaments still counted toward their live race? E.g. if someone has played more than six/seven 500s, 250s, challengers etc, will their worse results also count toward their live points?

6,tennis,Rant: Novak and his stance on vaccination,"Let me just say upfront, I am for vaccination, I have been vaccinated 2 times, my parents got 3rd dose last month, im going to get my 3rd shot within next month.


For the most part, I think people who wont get vaccinated really dont know what they are talking about. For example, Ive seen some musicians being against vaccination because ""They dont know what they are putting in to their body"". I mean, bunch of them, are taking illegal drugs through out their life from smoking pot (back when it was illegal in USA), speed, crack what ever... all kinds of drugs that someone smuggled through their ass to get across the border (not really, but i all those drugs warent made or smuggled in to a country in the most sanitary way lets just say that). Snorting a line from a strippers ass is apparently ok, but getting a vaccine thats been tested and approved by practically all countries and major organization, thats not safe apparently.

However, when I hear that from Novak... Novak is a health freak. This guy is one of the most disciplined athletes ever. He is vegetarian, doesnt eat gluten, eats only organic food, meditates, and, do I need to mention, exercises regularly. He never spoke against it, or pressured anyone not to be vaccinated, but when someone who takes care of his body like he does, I can understand where is he coming from.",1635262061

8,tennis,"A brief analysis and comparison of the big 3‚Äôs win streaks by surface, titles, and other metrics","All surfaces:

Federer: 41
Djokovic: 43
Nadal: 32

Hard court:

Federer: 56
Djokovic: 35
Nadal: 30

Clay court:

Federer: 14 (33 not including losses to Nadal)
Djokovic: 17 (27 not including losses to Nadal)
Nadal: 81 (8 streaks with more than 17)

Grass court:

Federer: 65 (5 fucking years unbeaten!)
Djokovic: 21
Nadal: 14

Slam wins:

Federer: 27 (twice with same tournaments)
Djokovic: 30 (4 streaks with 26+)
Nadal: 25

Slam finals: 

Federer: 10 (18 of 19 in a row!)
Djokovic: 5
Nadal: 5

Slam semifinals:

Federer: 23
Djokovic: 14
Nadal: 11

Slam quarterfinals:

Federer: 36
Djokovic: 28

Masters wins:

Federer: 18

Federer: 24 (reached 12 finals in a row after this streak)
Djokovic: 10
Nadal: 14

Conclusions: Nadal is (as we know already) absolutely inhuman on clay, and ruined goat level clay streaks for both Djokovic and Federer. Federer is the most dominant player of all time in is prime, with streaks that will never, ever be broken. Winning 24 straight finals is beyond a joke, and there‚Äôs a reason the saying was ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to play Federer on a Sunday‚Äù",1635258392

The thing is, carpet is the closest surface to grass, and would help serve as a warm up to the very short grass season. It would also encourage yet another level of versatility for all tour players and would be exciting for viewers to see a different surface on which the best of the best battle it out.

I consider myself a very chill person, and can not remember an occasion where I felt angry or frustrated about something this much. 

After about 4-5 months of playing tennis consistently, I felt very intense emotions at the end of a match for the first time. I felt angry for a long time and my mood was ruined for the rest of the day. I had to avoid more interactions with my close ones as I feared these emotions would flare up once again while I did not know how to deal with them. I picked up tennis as a new hobby since it was making me happy and fit but now it's making me develop intense emotions that might be bad for my character growth.

38,tennis,Appreciation for Michael Chang,"When I was a kid, I had the opportunity to be a ball boy for a men‚Äôs Challenger tournament. I didn‚Äôt really appreciate tennis history, and all I really knew was Sampras vs. Agassi at the time. That year the Challenger tournament hosted Andy Roddick, James Blake, Vince Spadea, and Michael Chang. Chang nearing the end of his career.

I didn‚Äôt really know who Michael Chang was at the time, but I noticed that his demeanor was VERY different from the other tennis players. For example, when he asked me for a towel on court, he didn‚Äôt just point at it or make a face-wiping motion. He looked at me and said, ‚ÄúWould you mind handing me that towel, please?‚Äù Everything was please and thank you, whether it was the ball kids or his opponent. This was in HOT and humid weather too. Very different from some of the other players who seemed to have no regard for other people on the court. Or even some who would yell at the staff when something wasn‚Äôt perfect (or just for the hell of it). Michael Chang was incredibly gracious to EVERYONE. Those little interactions made a very big impression on me as a kid.

I know that there are other players who pleasant people, but those few interactions with Michael Chang were so staggeringly different than the other players with who I came into contact that week. Now that I‚Äôm older, I can appreciate Michael Chang‚Äôs place in tennis history. There wasn‚Äôt any YouTube back then, so I‚Äôm having fun watching his matchplay in his prime.

Michael Chang is such an underappreciated professional American tennis player. World #2, the youngest man to ever win a grand slam (being the first American in a LONG time to win), 34 professional titles, and one of the youngest men's players to crack the ATP top 10. Although he ‚Äúonly‚Äù had one grand slam title under his belt, he is so rarely mentioned when talking about great American men‚Äôs tennis players. Maybe he isn't as explosive as Roddick, as iconic as James Blake, and doesn't have as many titles as McEnroe, but he deserves some recognition!

Just wanted to post that memory of him. I hope I can meet him again one day to thank him for what he has done for tennis!",1634919472

55,tennis,Opinion regarding Djokovic' many antiscience views,"Many people think Djokovic is a terrible and an extremely selfish person for being antivax. I disagree for the following reasons.
     Andre Agassi said Djokovic doesn't believe in  strength training and eating the right amount of protein after he decided to stop working with him. These two are the most important factors according to scientific research for improving athletic performance and even for general health in all humans. Also he decided to not have the elbow surgery for so long which actually affected him. It's clear that he just doesn't trust science and medicine as a whole even when it benefits him.From this, I don't see how him being antivax means he is a selfish person. Vaccination is a net benefit for almost all individuals and it is not even as irritating as wearing a mask everyday. You just get jabbed once or twice. He is not vaccinated not because he is selfish rather he doesn't understand science.

I and most of us are taught science in school and I saw how science explained and predicted most things in the world  and I gradually developed a trust in the scientific process. He is someone who didn't have proper education and he was mostly taught by his coach. He mentioned this in his autobiography. I don't see how it is possible for me and you to judge him on this. I have no idea how I would have turned out if I was raised in his circumstances.",1634898884

89,tennis,How to deal players who don't respect your game?,"I've been playing tennis for over a year and am around a 3.0. There's this guy I've played with a few times who can be nice and encouraging as he'll say when I hit good shots, etc

But numerous times he's said some things that I wasn't sure if he meant as a joke or if he was trying to insult my game and show that he's snobbish and doesn't respect my game. For example, when I asked him to rate some of the tennis players we played with, he was giving them ratings lower than I expected and would say ""oh, he's not that good"". For example, one player who I and everyone else thought was good and around a 3.5 - 4.0, he thought that player was only a 3.0. I then asked him to rate me, and he considered me as a 1.5, which I know is just not true as I've played tennis every week for a year mostly with players 3.5+ and I've taken plenty of private lessons and clinics. 

The snob also mentioned that he was going to play at courts with ""assholes"" because he said he himself was an asshole. He then mentioned that they would bully me if I played there. He has also been patronizing sometimes when I hit good shots and has also tried to give unsolicited advice to me numerous times even though he's probably a 3.5 at best, and has said that he would be better but his shoulders hurt and he's getting old

I talked about him with this other guy we both know. He mentioned I'm definitely not a 1.5 and that snob just talks nonsense alot of times, has gotten into conflicts with other people, and isn't even that good either. For example, when the snob mentioned how he was talking alot of trash with the ""asshole"" players or how he didn't want to play at a certain court because it had cracks, the other guy told me the snob was definitely lying about that since he's known him for years and he often plays at another court that has poor conditions.

So how do they handle their calorie intake before a match?

16,tennis,Beginner serve practice - should I coil/lean or stay stationary AND how firm of a grip?,"Still wondering why my serves are not consistent - have three aspects to think about for my own personal serve, addressed one with an instructor but not so sure about the other 2, which are:

\#1 Coiling -

Defined: In my view, I define coiling as the leaning forward and making the hips go over the baseline. Not sure if there's another term but this is what I think about when performing the action

When I coil, I feel it's much more effortless to land the ball in the service box. And by effortless, I mean I hit dead center in the box, not even a question of missing it. Supposedly having less body movement such as a stationary serve should make it easier to land the serve, but for me, it's not the case. Is this reasonable? 

Q: Should I lean every time while learning or just focus on just the upper body motion while practicing serves&gt;

\#2 Grip firmness

Defined: Basically how tight to hold, from scale 1-10 on effort. 1 being loose enough to nearly drop the racquet, 3 is normal for me right now for everything except for - 5+ to hold racquet for volleys.

I was playing mini-tennis with a coach for 2 hours, doing forehand and backhand volleys, and I noticed at the end when I wanted to practice a serve, having the slightly tighter grip made it more effortless to land dead center, when usually I have it more relaxed with a 3/10 effort. I ask because I saw some videos online saying grip should be somewhat firm but relaxed by gripping with only 4 fingers, leaving the index finger very loose for a loose wrist

Q: How much effort should I grip on serves? 1- very loose -3-normal 5- volleys 10-iron grip

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning to use some balsa wood to reinforce the extension beyond the hairpin, but I don't know what's the most optimal way to do this while being strong, without being overkill and preferrably reversible in case I don't like it extended (I probably will like it because I tried out more extreme 27,5"" rackets and liked them but still, I don't know how the Prestige will take it).

\#1 ensures tight fit by using a hammered-in wooden wedge between two pieces of balsa.

\#2 is demanding because i will have to make this balsa piece absolutely flawless to make it fit tightly

\#3 should be strong and not as demanding but I'm afraid I will have to order another pallet (and wait a month for it to arrive) if I don't like the result.

Will appreciate all input, especially from people who tried something similar.

49,tennis,Ideas for a CLI tennis simulation game?,"ok, this isn't really serious

So, I'm kind of obsessed with the tennis scoring system, and I'm also learning the c language, so recently I made a simple program that simulates a tennis match (just each player has 50% chance to win each point), just for fun. 

I remember we played a similar thing with my dad when I was like 5 years old, with flipping a coin. That's what inspired me.

 I really want to play tennis now, because the scoring system is very exciting, but 1. I can't play it irl now 2. My pc isn't very powerful to run any existing games like AO tennis etc, and I couldn't manage to run them on linux anyway. and i didn't like them anyway when I got to play them. 

 So now I started learning c++, and now I kinda want to make something more complex, i.e. 

1. make it so you can actually somehow control the game, e.g. choose how to hit, topspin or slice, etc.
2. make it so when you serve, you actually have an advantage
3. implement some kind of a momentum thing, e.g. you have better chance of winning if you have won several points in a row or something like this, idk yet
4. and other things that may make it more exciting

I don't yet know enough to make a game with graphics, so it's a console line game obviously

ok, so I just wanted to ask if you can suggest any ideas? and maybe ideas how to write the functions and structure everything?

and i still idk how to actually write it, so far i think a ""player"" class is definitely necessary, it'll be something like

    class player
      {
        private:
          char* name = nullptr;
          int points = 0;
          int games = 0;
          int sets = 0;
          int aces = 0;
          int unforced_errors = 0;
          etc.
        public:
          int serve(player&amp; opp); 
          etc.
      };

idk if i need something like a ""game""/""set""/""match"" class, or maybe something like a friend function of class player",1634756211

If anyone else has had similar problems that they solved, please let me know your recommendations.

I understand I could choose from the following:

* Bigger size shoes and thicker socks
* Cushioned socks at the toes \[any particular socks?\]
* Taping the toe to the next toe along \[any particular tapes?\]
* Ensuring toenails are cut \[I'm not sure this will be good enough by itself and should probably be something I do automatically\]

54,tennis,Some young players you should know about 2020 -- where are they now? Part III: WTA,"I found [this post from the archives](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/jaeczi/oc_some_young_players_you_should_know_about/) on a random search a couple of weeks back. That post, presenting several promising youngsters to look out for, was written on October 12th 2020. The original poster has since deleted their account, but I thought it would be fun to do a one-year follow-up anyway.

I split this post up into several parts. Part I, on ATP players from the list above, is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q0koy8/some_young_players_you_should_know_about_2020/), and Part II, on new names to look out for on the men's side, is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q6gx9k/some_young_players_you_should_know_about_part_ii/). In this third part, I'm looking at the WTA players that were highlighted as names to watch last year. As before, I'll be covering all names from the original list, in the order they were presented. Each player also has tags (Country; Age in format years.months; world ranking on the 12th October 2020 list; current ranking at time of posting). If players are also active Juniors, then their current Junior ranking will be included as well (or instead, if they only play on the Junior circuit), with a prefix J. Hence, for example: **Clara Burel** (France; 20.7; 240; 75) makes her 20 years and 7 months old, ranked 240 on October 12th 2020, and is 75th on the most recent list (18th October).

**2020 (and earlier) breakthroughs**

**Clara Burel** (France; 20.7; 240; 75): At the time of the post above, Burel had broken into the Top 250 for the first time following a run to the third round at Roland Garros. Since then she's continued to progress, with three ITF titles, the most recent of which was earlier this month in Cherbourg, and a WTA250 final at Lausanne, seeing her to her career-high ranking of 75th. Still, we are perhaps waiting for that big tour-level title win that will propel her to the status of some of her younger fellow stars.

**Cori ""Coco"" Gauff** (USA; 17.7; 55; 23): Even now I think it's easy to overlook Gauff or forget how young she still is, but she's continuing to move up the rankings, debuting in the Top 20 for the first time recently on the back of consistent deep runs in tournaments in the first half of this season, including her second WTA title and debut Grand Slam QF appearance. Has also the potential for a promising doubles career, making the US Open finals with Caty McNally, and reaching the Indian Wells doubles QF with Leylah Fernandez. And on top of that she's *still* the youngest of the established players on this list! I'm sure there's more to come yet.

**Leylah Fernandez** (Canada; 19.1; 89; 27): it was her run to the third round at RG2020 that got Fernandez mentioned in last year's post. 2021 saw her win her first WTA title, at Monterrey. After that, she struggled a bit for consistency, winning nine matches but losing 11. And then the US Open happened. That run of victories over Osaka, Kerber, Svitolina and Sabalenka will live long in the memory. Making them all dramatic three-setters too was a lovely touch! What's been perhaps even more impressive is how she sustained that form into Indian Wells, beating another top player in Pavlyuchenkova and only narrowly losing to Shelby Rogers. Can't wait to see what is next for her, not least because her brand of tennis is seriously exciting to watch. Never lets up in intensity or willpower, and a great match-player. The only thing that makes me wonder how far she can go right now is that her serve is a little vulnerable, meaning that she isn't often winning matches quickly -- that's something she might try to work on. If she can fix that she'll go far.

**Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek** (Poland; 20.5; 17; 11): Imagine winning your debut title at Roland Garros, picking up two more titles the following season, making the fourth round or better at every Slam (being the only woman this season to do so), briefly breaking into the Top 5, and still being basically overshadowed by everybody around you of a similar age. But  Swiatek's season following her remarkable RG2020 victory has been very impressive, and I don't doubt for a second that she'll stay at the top of the game for a long time yet. Perhaps even the relative lack of attention will help her focus on just playing well and continuing to improve. Another player whose style of play I've come to enjoy.

**Young Players to Watch**

**Wang Xiyu** (China; 20.7; 120; 140): Since her semi-final run at Acapulco, sadly 2018 US Open Junior champion Wang hasn't been on a great run of form this year, with a run of seven straight losses at the start of the year. Also hasn't played a Tour-level match since July, in part because of a focus on the China National Games. Picked up a WTA125 doubles title recently, and made her return to singles last week in a W25 event, reaching the final, so perhaps she'll be soon back on track.

**Elisabetta Cocciaretto** (Italy; 20.9; 131; 137): Another player who hasn't yet broken through, although this time primarily due to a knee injury, as she hasn't played since July. Apparently, she's [recently had surgery and is still in rehab](https://www.viveremacerata.it/2021/10/12/tathiana-garbin-ed-elisabetta-cocciaretto-al-centro-tennis-tolentino/1046748). Had a nice run to the semi-finals at Guadalajara in March, which helped her reach 108 in the rankings, but we'll have to wait until next season to see if she can recover and live up to last year's potential.

**Wang Xinyu** (China; 20.1; 150; 114):  Last year, Wang Xiyu's slightly younger near-namesake was only mentioned in passing, but I thought I'd expand on her a bit. Xinyu's junior career was less prolific than some, reaching a couple of Junior Slam semis but losing to Swiatek and Burel. Her last two junior matches were a double-bagel victory over Leylah Fernandez, and a narrow defeat to Clara Tauson, so she was competitive with many of the stars of this generation. Started playing Adult tournaments in 2016, winning her first ITF title in 2018 and three on the bounce in 2019, bringing her into the Top 150 this time last year. 2021 started slowly, but Xinyu's retained and slightly improved her ranking, with season-best results being the semis at Prague in July, and the finals at the Columbus W125 in September. Played this week in Tenerife and had a good run, but sadly had to pull out of her match against Cornet due to an injury. 

**Clara Tauson** (Denmark; 18.10; 155; 48): 2021 has definitely been Tauson's breakthrough season. Two WTA250 titles, a victory over a certain Emma Raducanu to win the Chicago WTA125, and a climb up to just inside the Top 50. In any normal season she'd probably be a shoo-in for the Most Improved Player of the Year Award, although I suspect that'll go to Krejcikova. I should also add that her manner of victory over Ostapenko at Luxembourg, to win her second Tour title, was seriously impressive. Only six unforced errors through the entire match, to 31 winners! Still plenty she can add to her game, but this was a great call by our anonymous poster, and I'm sure we've yet to see even close to Tauson's full potential. Also featuring in Tenerife this week.

**Maria Camila Osorio Serrano** (Colombia; 19.10; 205, 63): The sixth highest-ranked under-20 player on the WTA, Osorio Serrano has definitely justified her place in this list too. Her debut title came on home soil, which must have been a wonderful moment for her, and since then she's reached a couple of semi-finals, as well as the third round at Wimbledon, taking her up to 63rd for a climb of almost 150 ranking places. Since Wimbledon, Osorio Serrano has had a bit of a barren run, with one win from seven matches, but that came to an end with her career-best win over Svitolina at Tenerife this week. 

**Alexandra Eala** (Philippines; 16.5; N/A; 525; J2; J4): As with the rest of the players in the WTA list, she's still too young to judge, but the last year has nevertheless been a fine one for Eala. She's mixing junior tournaments with low-tier ITF tournaments, winning one this year, and has even played one WTA250 main draw, earning her debut victory at that level. As a result, she's climbed all the way up to just outside the top 500. Another fine shout, then, and keep an eye on her next season! 

**Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva** (Andorra; 16.2; N/A; 390; J1; J1): The Andorran youngster has also tried her luck at ITF tournaments, with her best result a run to the final at San Bartolome only a couple of months back. Perhaps somewhat tired from her efforts, she got thrashed by Arantxa Rus, but must nevertheless have been thrilled to win seven straight matches and charge up the rankings. She recently broke the Top 400, too, and is among the top teenagers on tour right now. Another to keep an eye on for the next couple of seasons as she continues to play both juinors and ITF events.

**Brenda Fruhvirtova** (Czechia, 14; J309\*; J10): When she was included last year, she had just won a junior title (and helped the Czechs to the World Junior Tennis Finals title in 2019). Since then, she's added five more junior titles to her collection, progressing up the junior ladder to become already among the Top 10 juniors. There are still, I think, a couple of years before we'll see her competing at senior events, but there's no doubting that Brenda is among the top junior talents already. Also worth noting that she's on a 15-match winning streak, and has won 26 of her last 28 matches. (\*J309 is her end of 2020 ranking.) 

**Honourable mentions**

**Robin Montgomery** (USA; 17.1; 560: 372; J7\*; J2): Follows up her honourable mention last year with a victory at the US Open Girls' singles this year, making her the second-ranked junior behind Kasintseva (whom she beat on the way to that US Open title). Hasn't had as much success on the senior circuit yet, but notable results include a victory over Osorio Serrano earlier this year, and with a ranking inside the Top 400 has continued to move steadily up. (\*J7 is her end of 2020 ranking.) 

**Daria Snigur** (Ukraine; 19.7; 224; 184): Snigur made the honourable mentions presumably off the back of three ITF titles and the 2019 Wimbledon Girls' singles title. She's added one more ITF title in 2021, and has made it to the Top 200 on the back of another final, but has not perhaps shone to the same level as many others on this list. Still plenty of time of course, and is at least moving in the right direction!

**Daria Lopatetska** (Ukraine; 18.6; 356; 482): Lopatetska burst onto the scene three years ago, winning her first 18 adult-level matches, and five of her first ten ITF tournaments, as a result zooming up the rankings to a peak of 216, while still barely 16. Then she suffered a knee injury in 2019, and it seems that she hasn't fully recovered from it to this day. After another extended break, from July this year, on the back of five straight losses, she returned to the court earlier this month and is back to winning matches again. A long road back, but if she's back to fitness maybe the results will come again to match her clear talent.

**Linda Fruhvirtova** (Czechia; 16.5; 787; 335; J18\*; J8): Brenda's older sister is no less promising, with two ITF titles and two further finals already, and a good result at Charleston in April 2021 -- admittedly, in part because Cornet retired, but only when Linda had taken her to a third set. Already being inside the Top 350 makes her the third-best under-18 player in the WTA rankings, ahead of several others on the list above. Still mixing junior and adult events, Both sisters have great potential, and it won't be a surprise to see them both break through within the next few years.  (\*J18 is her end of 2020 ranking.)

 \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* 

Last, but not least, eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that I skipped one name from the original list...

**Emma Raducanu** (UK; 18.11; 344; 24): When our esteemed u/\[deleted\] included Raducanu in this list, she was described a promising youngster whose results were nevertheless ""pedestrian"", and hadn't yet played a main tour match. A year later, she's a history-making US Open champion. I'm still not sure how that happened. Not gonna lie, Raducanu's the reason I found this list... what a prediction u/\[deleted\] made! I don't think they had *this* set of results in mind though! That she's barely even started is the most impressive, and the scariest, aspect of this incredible breakthrough. The next stage of Emma's career is perhaps going to be the most important, as she's basically skipped all of the usual grinds through lower-tier tournaments that many of the others above have gone through, and is currently looking for a coach, and for that matter her first tour win outside Slams.

 \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* 

Seven clear successes (Burel, Gauff, Fernandez, Swiatek, Tauson, Osorio Serrano, Raducanu); five moving in the right direction without breaking through yet (Eala, Kasintseva, Brenda Fruhvirtova, Montgomery, Linda Fruhvirtova); and five who've probably been stalled in part due to injury or other factors (Wang Xiyu, Cocciaretto, Wang Xinyu, Snigur, Lopatetska). Whoever u/\[deleted\] was, they're a genius.

My list...

* Murray - 3 Slam titles, Always living in the shadow of the Big Three, but a fighter nonetheless. He rewrote the history books with his historic 2013 Wimbledon title and backing it up in 2016, along with TWO Olympic gold medals.
* Safin - 2 Slam titles, Marat was super talented but a headcase who made tennis frustrating yet enjoyable to watch. When he was on, he could win any match.

**WTA:**

* Henin - 7 Slam titles, Justine was dominant on clay and had one of the best 1HBH on tour.
* Venus - 7 Slam titles, Venus was a grass court specialist and had the serve and groundstrokes to capture 5 Wimbledon titles.
* Azarenka - 2 Slam titles, Vika had some memorable rivalries on the WTA Tour and possessed (possesses?) one of the best returns of serve in the game. 
* Raducanu - 1 Slam title, So a bit of recency bias but Emma's story of coming from qualifying to Slam winner, all without dropping a set, is one for the movies and ended the drought of a British woman Slam winner.",1634736627

78,tennis,I think Novak will be forced to retire from Tennis,"Now the Australian open has effectively banned Novak from playing there unless he can prove he‚Äôs been double vaccinated I only see this as an opportunity for every tournament on the entire ATP and WTA tour to follow suit. It would be bizarre for only the AO to enforce these draconian rules and I see the other 3 majors announcing the same rules and that players will have to be double jabbed to p,ay there or they won‚Äôt be allowed, simple.
So Novak has 2 options, get vaccinated and play where he wants, or be refused entry to literally all the tournaments that mean something to him such as the slams and opt not to play unless the rules are changed again or he announces his retirement. 
I think if he were still on 17 slams today he wouldn‚Äôt be playing because the travelling and Covid rules would be too much for him, he only played last year because the ‚Äúgrand slam‚Äù was on the line.

91,tennis,Andy Murray's year really shows how brutal tour life is for low ranking players,"It might be a bit of an obvious thing to say but with Murray plying his trade in the lower reaches of the rankings this year and relying on WCs to play in tournaments, it has really shown how unforgiving the tour can be until you can get to that 1200/1300 point mark.

His opponents in recent tournaments have been insane. 

Indian Wells - Zverev, 3rd round

San Diego - Ruud, second round

Metz, Humbert, first round, Hurkacz QF

USO - Tsitsipas, 1st round

Cincinnati - Hurkacz, second round

Wimbledon - Basilashvili 1st round (in poor form at the time), Shapovalov, 3rd round

Queens - Paire (in poor form at the time) 1st round, Berretini 2nd round

Rotterdam - Rublev, 2nd round

Granted there are some weird losses in between some of those but just looking at how early he is hitting top players is amazing. When I was thinking about it, it struck me that this is what Tour life is like for a lot of players. In some cases for a large part of their careers.

I've never been a fan of seeding in any sport but I understand why it exists. Murray's example this year might be particularly unlucky but I think it's given me a new appreciation (or better insight maybe) into  the struggle of players I've maybe dismissed as ""first round losers"" before.",1634689571

6,tennis,"Andy's doing great, but he can do better."," 
Love this guy, but wanted to share some thoughts about his game atm. Honestly I'm not sure how this is sustainable to grind out the rallies every single point. No wonder he's had some of the longest matches of his CAREER at this stage (3h 45m against Tiafoe tonight!), when he just lacks that efficiency he used to have when he was younger. 

The trademark of Murray's game always used to be grinding down the opponent but then pulling off incredible on the run winners to evaporate the opponent's will to win, kinda like Novak does. But now as he's getting older, he's way less consistent to pull off that kinda magic from unlikely positions, allowing a more even split, and at the end of the day not enough to pull away from opponents to ease through his matches. 

In a way I'm really glad his plan A, defensive baseliner, still works and is good enough against even a Top 10 level. That's a huge positive. But at this stage of his career, he should really try and be brave but in a different way, and try and finish points sooner - whether that means by injecting more pace into his shots, which he's shown he can still do quite well, or as you'd have guessed by now, by creating opportunities to finish at the net. 

Andy has one of the most underrated net games on tour, with great feel on both sides as well as incredible feel for the ball. I really think of he can get to the net on around 20-25% points, that would save him from a TON of running and wearing down his metal hip further.",1634677594

15,tennis,Opinion : 2019 Federer is better than 2018 Federer,"When people discuss Federer‚Äôs best season, I often see people considering 2018 as a continuation to 2017 and another incredible year.

Yeah, considering his age, it was quite huge. Although, I think it‚Äôs miles behind 2017, 2014, 2015 and even 2019.

His level during the year was very weird and inconsistent. He played well though inconsistent in the AO to win it, then it went downhill with a only a very few ups (first rounds in Wimbledon i.e)

In 2019, after his loss to Tsitsipas in the AO, his level gigantly stepped up. He immediately took his revenge, almost made the sunshine double (whereas he looked shady in 18), had an incredible clay season for a 37 yo.

Then came Wimbledon where we all know how he played and what would have happened had he converted that MP.

Though worse than the other tournaments, he still did better than in 2018 after Wimbledon.

So though there is 1+ slam in 2018, I just think he looked and did better one year later.

What do you think (sorry for this English btw )",1634672022

31,tennis,Subreddit in Review,"We, the mod team, hope you enjoyed the USO and all of the drama and content shared during the duration. As a new mod team, we took on many responsibilities when we stepped into the role just before the USO and feel that we‚Äôve made many strides forwards for this Subreddit in terms of behavior and reporting. However, we know many areas still require improvements.

We aim within this post to detail and describe how we seek to bring improvements to the Subreddit and in what manner we shall enforce such new changes. We also seek to hear from you - the users - on your thoughts and concerns about topics not mentioned here.

**Sexism**

**Current State:** We feel that sexism and sexist remarks have become a prevalent issue within this Subreddit especially in match threads and Goat discussions. ‚ÄúLocker room‚Äù talk has become commonplace in both disregarding WTA players achievements due to their overall strength compared to men and sexual/insulting comments directed towards WTA players appearances. For example, negative comments spiked in matches when Leylah Fernandez and Emma Raducanu where taking places.

This policy also applies to ATP players when comments about their appearances occur too. For example, we have noticed such comments during the matches of Francis Tiafoe and Matteo Berrettini.

**Improvements Required:**

To stem such sexism, we seek to take a hard line against such comments. The utilization of warnings and temporary bans aim to discourage continued behaviour from users. Encouragement of gendered Goat debates will also try to prevent such disagreements.

We seek to take a no-tolerance stance on sexual comments and will hand out bans respective of such.

**WTA**

**Current State:** WTA has been seen as undervalued on this subreddit. Many of the current issues of the aforementioned subject play a role in WTA content frequency, plus limited opportunities to have WTA discussion have proven an obstacle. A common hypothesis was that most users didn‚Äôt engage with WTA or show a desire too; however, user upvote/comment patterns during the USO suggested otherwise.

**Improvements Required:**

\- Increasing availability of WTA discussion and creating an environment where people can discuss such topics without negative comments or sexist remarks.

\- Discussion of possible future WTA AMA‚Äôs with official representatives if opportunity presents itself.

**Memes**

**Current State:** The meme community in the subreddit has been healthy and abundant with multiple meme posting daily. Concerns have been raised towards the frequency of meme posting and that of the overall quality of such posts. Memes have also been used as a method of baiting users into arguments in the same manner as some Big 3 threads have.

**Improvements Required:**

Many options of how to regulate memes have been considered with many pros and cons to each solution. **No one choice is set in stone as of the date of this post:**

\- Memes only allowed on certain day of the week

OR

\- Low effort meme rule

Memes pose a difficult situation for us as they play an important role in allowing us to gauge community thoughts as well as popular topics.

**Bad Faith**

**Current State:** Many discussions in the Big 3 flair possess a degree of bad faith in where users engage in debate with no intention to debate fairly or accept the other side's points. Such offences include:

\- Discounting another player achievements within an argument to benefit your own argument

\- Engaging discussion under false pretenses

\- Concern trolling &amp; ""sealioning"" other users

**Improvements Required:**

Stricter enforcement of rules on offending posts and education of what defines ‚Äúbad faith‚Äù within rules to prevent unaware rule breaking in the community. Heightened alertness during Big 3 matches, active restriction of debate posts during occasions of either WTA or Big 3 contention.

**Rules**

**Current State:** We felt that many times when we enforced the rules that some users felt unclear to how such rules affected their post/comments. Rules such as #1 (Play Nice) &amp; #5 (Low Effort Rule) lack clarification for removals; sometimes a rule wasn‚Äôt in place for certain outlier situations.

**Improvements Require:**

Revision and expansion of rules to include more in depth explanations for users and give wider moderator understanding of rule breaking behaviour. Coming Soon.

Additional reasoning for post removal replies to increase clarity.

**Reporting**

**Current State:** During the USO, we had a user report backlog going back to last year. Many cases of rule breaking behaviour had been reported and had gone unreviewed by the mod team due to lack of moderators available. During the USO, the mod team has successfully cleared the backlog to allow accurate monitoring of reports from users with relative success during the USO.

While user reports did increase during the USO, many accounts of rule breaking behaviour had gone unreported, which left the detection of such posts/comments down to moderators, unfortunately increasing the amount of time offensive comments remain up.

**Improvements Required:**

\- Continued encouragement of reporting to users in daily match threads and post match posts, using stickies and face of sub moderators.

\- Active transparency towards users to demonstrate the process and outcomes for when comments/posts are reported, building confidence within the community.

**Mod-User Relationship**

**Current State:** Before the USO, many of the mod team were unable to actively daily moderate the subreddit due to IRL obligations. As such, many users had complained of a lack of moderation within the subreddit as a cause of increased rule breaking and off topic discussion, leading to low morale between both parties. With the introduction of the new mod team members, an active drive to increase visibility has been established as a method of building support from concerned users and of deterring rule breaking through increased active presence. While some users have objected to such sticky posts, we feel this course of action is still the most viable towards achieving our set goals for the meanwhile.

**Improvements Required:**

\- Continued presence in popular threads.

\- Increased approachable behaviour to users both in modmail and comment sections for concerns raised on all matters.

\- Introduction of a new universal mod ""u/NextGenBot"" for handling of posts and scheduling stickies, etc.

**Misinformation**

**Current State:** We find that occasionally content is shared within the Subreddit that is worded to start drama or is just plain false, many of these offenders are online articles or journalists abusing the trust users put in their reporting.

**Improvements Required:** The banning of misinformation by known web pages &amp; journalists (ex. Luigi Gatto) on the subreddit, which will be detailed in the rules update.",1634654268

Obviously, I loved watching Federer and his strokes looked so beautiful, that I wanted to emulate him. So there you have it, that's the main reason. It just looks so damn cool.

I hit a forehand crosscourt to the deuce side;
He gets it back;
Forehand down the line to the ad side, make my way to the net;
He barely gets this back, so puts the ball up in the air;
I decide to hit an overhead smash behind him, as I assume he will run to the deuce side;
I hit the smash fairly hard to ad half of the court;
He was running the deuce side, but on seeing the ball go behind him, puts his racket behind his back while on the move;
Ball hits the strings, goes over my head, and lands a foot inside the baseline for a behind-the-back lob winner off an overhead smash.

72,tennis,Apparently WTA decided leave Indian Wells 2019 points on the board,"Every source of live ranking was convinced 2019 Indian Wells points were being replaced by IW 2021 points, but apparently WTA decided that they'll use ""best of 2019 and 2021"" system, meaning that if you did better in Indian Wells in 2019 than 2021 you still get to keep those points.

I get why that was done last year when players were returning to tour and some of them didn't feel comfortable travelling for the tournaments. I even get why this was done early this year. But it needs to stop now.

Right now:

\- players who did well in RG 2020 are losing their points after 12 months which is fair enough

\- players who did well in AO 2020 still have their points on the board after 20 months

\- players who did well in IW 2019 still have their points on the board after 31 (!) months.

&amp;#x200B;

How does that make sense?",1634594328

I have full control over my forehand, decent serve and slice. My 2 handed backhand has 0 control and goes either in the net or in the sky. 

Now I have an interesting thing to say, because after playing sometimes every week for half a year I still didn't get my 2 handed backhand to a normal level even after yt vids (0 control). But I swapped to a 1 handed backhand by watching a couple of vids on yt and it's instantly already way better than my 2 handed backhand (more control and power and spin).

97,tennis,A more approachable online tennis program for beginners: thoughts?,"Hi all,

When I first started picking up tennis last year, I found the amount of content online and on YouTube quite overwhelming, and it was difficult to navigate as a beginner to the sport.

Since then, I've stumbled around enough to get myself to 3.0-3.5. That being said, I would have appreciated a more clear-cut and simpler path to learning how to tennis (besides of course paying for in-person lessons).

I decided to work with a pro tennis coach (Matt's previously been the coach for Genie Bouchard, Bianca Andreescu &amp; Sharon Fichman and currently teaches at a club) to create tennis content that's structured so it's approachable to a complete newbie.

We wanted to get the community's feel &amp; feedback on our beginner curriculum, and what you think can be improved. Eventually we hope to create a large free library of curated programs, lessons + drills for all skill levels (subsidized by more ""premium content"").

To be transparent: we're not looking for free advertising here, rather we hope to gather feedback early on from some passionate tennis players so we can iterate and refine our content so it just works. Feel free to remove if this linking is prohibited:

Now I'm a 200 lb wannabe body builder that can't put the pizza down to lose that last 5% of bodyfat, so I'm hitting the ball significantly harder than I used to and the racket does feel pretty light. Anywho, I really enjoyed it and me and my dad are going to hit the courts three times a week now.

Looking at racquet prices, nothing seems out of my price range, but I still feel like I need a beginner/lower intermediate racquet that gives me a bit more control and less power.

Racquet demo'd - 

Prince Thunder 26, Head Speed Pro \*current\*, Yonex VCore 97HD, Wilson Prostaff 97 V13, Head Extreme Tour, Babolat Pure Drive, Babolat Pure Aero, Babolat EVO Drive Lite, Yonex Ezone Ace, Technifibre TFight 315 RS \*current backup\*

Currently like both Head and Technifibres, can't really decide which is better, the ease of use with Technifibre or the forgiving head. Got technifibre 315 because yonex 97HD was great when demo'd but wanted something that was a little more affordable as yonex seems to be high end in racquet frames.

Strings demo'd/tried before with personal thoughts

Head Lynx 1.30mm, Head Hawk 1.20mm at 58 lbs | Head Speed Pro | Felt great on first day, then progressively more trampoline-y afterwards

Head Lynx 1.30mm full bed at 59 lbs | Head Speed Pro | Felt great halfway through on second day, then again more trampoline-y afterwards with balls landing into the back fence

Technifibre BiPhase One 1.30mm at 55 lbs | Technifibre TFight 315 RS | Really good for practicing heavy top spin, since shots tended to fly really long, but sweet spot felt quite small

Yonex Poly Tour Bite 1.300mm at 54 lbs \*by a Master Racquet stringer\* | Head Speed Pro | Current setup, feels best, shots landing within the court with minimal effort on control

I usually compete in tournaments about twice a month and occasionally I will hit during the week. I get the racquets strung typically at 53 lbs. I've tried to contact Yonex but they won't replace them since the warranty is only 1 year, I got two in 2019, two in 2020.

Muguruza and Sakkari need to only win 1 match (as they have a bye in Round 1) in Moscow to overtake Swiatek in Race ranking, while Jabeur would need to get to the final. Sakkari and Jabeur also signed up for Courmayeur 250 a week later where they have even more chance to get some points.

If that happens, Swiatek is down to 8th. And if Badosa wins IW tomorrow, she will be within striking distance of Swiatek. Badosa is also signed up to play Cluj-Napoca 250 the week of October 25th and if she gets to the final there, then she pushes Swiatek out of the top 8.

46,tennis,Help choosing Racket(blade 98l v6 vs pure drive),"Hi  


I think I have graduated from being an absolute noob at the game, to a somewhat not bad player, alongside my partner. I want to upgrade my entry level rackets to something that will stay with me for years and develop my game (I still am far from being good at the game)

&amp;#x200B;

The dilemma is between a couple of kinda new Wilson blade 98l v6 (pictures attached), and a couple of old Babolat pure drive (Not sure which year, and I couldn't really find pictures online to help me know, also it could be a plus model). There's also a single Wilson ultra 100 (2016), and a couple of Wilson Pro Staff 97ls (though I'm not sure if these are not fake)

&amp;#x200B;

I will attach pictures of all the rackets, hoping for your help. Since I'm buying for myself and a partner, I want both of them to be somewhat similarly good

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, we still need to develop our game, so while all rackets may be good, I want to choose 2 that will serve us for a decent number of years

2009 - This time, Rafa lost to Delpo in the Semis. Would have faced Fed in the final

2008 - Rafa lost in the semis again, this time to Murray. Would have been amazing to see them play a Major final again right after that Wimbledon match

When I started watching IW, I was surprised that there was no commentary, but I dig it! Recently, I went back to watch two matches (Murray vs. Zverev and Dimitrov vs. Medvedev), but the replays are different from the original broadcast in two ways.

1. They have commentary. I can deal, but why is this?
2. More importantly, **they sped up the play**. It's not much, but it's definitely noticeable. So again, I ask what the hell, TennisTV? Any ideas why they would do this? Is this typical for TTV?",1634216645

I've been using the same tennis racket (Babolat aero, not sure what exact model) for a couple of years now, and before hand it was my mums for a couple of years, and I've probably had it re strung around 8 times when the strings have snapped, a few chips of the top of the racket head but no major cracks. 

 I was wondering how long most rackets last, and if I got the new updated model, would I notice much of an upgrade/difference, or for club level players is there no difference and it'd just be a waste of money?

94,tennis,What we can do as a community in response to all the social media hate the players receive after matches.,"So the most recent post was about Ruud and there were some pretty dark comments, unfortunately per usual from people with gambling problems. My first thought was that I wish they hadn‚Äôt blocked out the names so I could go send these people a message asking them why they are doing this. Then I realized, it‚Äôs all public for anyone who wants to see it on instagram. 

Going through Ruud‚Äôs most recently posted pic, scroll down the comments, and eventually you start seeing the comments roll in (huge warning for anyone sensitive to language). I sent the following message to a bunch of people who‚Äôs accounts weren‚Äôt either private or since deleted: Why do you gamble your own money and then call out professional athletes on social media?

Look, I know this isn‚Äôt a solution to the problem. I know it will continue. But so many people these days think they can act without consequences, and they don‚Äôt realize other people see what they are saying. And until they do, sometimes they‚Äôll never stop. It‚Äôs a lot of the same people posting over and over again, clearly getting more and more upset. 

Who‚Äôs with me? It took me maybe 5 minutes to copy and paste the same message to about 15 accounts. Let‚Äôs try and make this a thing of the past. 

Are there other things we can do? I‚Äôm open to any and all solutions to what we can do as a community to help tennis players around the world.",1634213542

4,tennis,I think Zverev has the best chance to dominate the tour in the future but most people are even afraid to talk about his tennis performance nowadays,"When I see discussions about ""how tennis will be when the big 3 retires"" on tennis media, whether on twitter or reddit, majority of the people believe that Medvedev or Tsitsipas will win a lot of slams and will dominate the tour. Or even Sinner, Musetti, etc. some teenagers once they mature a bit more but interestingly, I don't hear Zverev's name much in these discussions. 

He has been playing at a ridiculous level over a year. He used to have these mental breakdowns where he was making 4-5 double faults in a row couple of years ago but he seems like his game is much more stable, both mentally and technically. He has a huge serve, great movement for a tall guy and the best backhand next to Nole, in my opinion, but the most important thing is, despite Medvedev and Tsitsipas, his game is rock solid on any surface which makes him the best candidate for this role. Medvedev's flat game style only allows him to play at this level on fast hard courts, especially since grass courts are not as fast as they used to be. Tsitsipas is a bit better all-round player but his game is the best on slow surfaces. Either clay or hard indoors. Whereas Zverev's game is pretty much at the same level for both surfaces and his game style suits perfect to grass as well although he hasn't really had any success on it yet. It's definitely improvable. 

However, with all the allegations and his personal life issues, most people are even afraid to give compliments to his game which doesn't make any sense to me. I wish there was no political correctness at least on tennis. Those are allegations and has nothing to do with tennis. If the guy  is playing good, he is playing good. I don't understand why people are afraid to talk about it. No one is tweeting anything, sharing great shots of Zverev during Zverev matches on social media, whereas everyone is online during a Medvedev or Tsitsipas match. He doesn't get enough praise for what he has done this year.",1634205969

My daughter is 13, tall and relatively skinny!!! and has begun tennis lessons. It's been 2 months now and she seems to enjoy it. Her godmother gave her an old HEAD mg2 racquet and after an hour of practicing she felt pain on her wrist. She tried her trainers racquets: HEAD SPEED LITE, EXTREME, INSTINCT 360 LITE(older model)and felt very comfortable with the latest.
I'm considering buying the Instinct 360+ LITE or the Wilson Clash 100L which after searching around seems to be very arm friendly.

15,tennis,Why did Martina Hingis fade so quickly?,"Martina is definitely of my favourite players ever (even though I mostly followed her doubles resurgence, as I was too young to watch her late 90s/early 00s). What she achieved in 1997 and at that period was nothing short of remarkable, especially being only 16 years old and lacking power.

One can probably look at many reasons why she lost her dominance. An obvious one would be the emergence of the Williams sisters and the fact that she was not suited for the power era of big hitters that followed. Others can talk about injuries, also the horse incident if I recall correctly.

But I am still not sure why she didn't win more. She is one of the smartest players to ever play, she was unmatched in terms of positioning, precision, anticipation and net game. 

Do you think she won so much because of being in a transitional period between Graf and Williams sisters (similar to how Hewitt was dominating between Sampras and Roger), or she could have won even more back then?",1634194818

45,tennis,Year-end #1 situation after Medvedev lost in the Round of 16 of Indian Wells.,"Medvedev is currently 1900 points behind Djokovic in the live Race to Turin which is deciding YE #1 this year. With his loss to Dimitrov, it has become much harder for Medvedev to catch up to Djokovic and get YE #1. One hypothetical scenario in which Medvedev would overtake Djokovic and get YE #1 would be if Djokovic didn't play for the rest of the year and Medvedev won Paris Masters and was the runner-up in Tour Finals after winning 3 round-robin matches along the way. But if Djokovic only plays Tour Finals and wins just 1 round-robin match, Medvedev would need to win Paris Masters and Tour Finals with 3 round-robin wins along the way. Technically speaking, there is a maximum of 3250 points on offer for the rest of 2021 after Indian Wells (Antwerp 250, Vienna 500, Paris Masters, Stockholm 250, and Tour Finals), so Medvedev could make the job easier by taking wildcards into the 250s and/or 500s, but I doubt he will do that. Djokovic could clinch the YE #1 if he wins Paris Masters and Medvedev doesn't make it to the finals. But Djokovic would only have to do that much if Medvedev wins a 250 and a 500 between now and Paris Masters. If Medvedev does not play between now and Paris Masters, Djokovic could clinch YE #1 by winning Paris Masters (regardless of Medvedev's result). So, it seems pretty likely that Djokovic will be YE #1.",1634167600

5,tennis,"As a tennis player, have you ever had a moment where your luck began to shift?","Okay so long story short growing up I never was drawn to competitive activity , and I don‚Äôt have too much experience with it. Like for example I would primarily play single player videogames and what not and not be too heavily invested into a single thing where I was dedicated in reaching top of the ranks, school included. Of course I have the reputation of picking things up easily and learning fast and I kind of sit with that reputation - being able to do things with less effort than other people - and never really moving past that stage. 

I know some people seem just naturally good and more at home in the competitive mindset in which case crosses over into any competitive related field. It feels like they just have that stroke of luck which other people don‚Äôt . That things are stressful but there‚Äôs a sense of control in the situation and  that the outcome could very much be swayed to their favor. 

It seems this is a gift which some people have. Of course practice and experience counts the most but I feel like it only goes so far. And some people just have this stroke of competitive spirit which is an  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to win‚Äù attitude which probably is displayed early as a kid. 

I‚Äôm someone who often hears the term talented, or genius thrown at me a lot but when it comes to anything that is competitive nature I‚Äôve lost far more than I‚Äôve won. I‚Äôm wondering for some, was there ever a lightbulb moment in your life where at one point you felt in a perpetual state of losing until some point there was a spiritual shift in you where you felt like you had luck on your side ? Or would you say it is either a natural gift or an extremely slow gradual process that the change simply crept up on you?",1634105855

Let's also assume that Zverev plays and wins all of the following tournaments in the remainder of the year: ATP Masters 1000 Indian Wells, ATP Masters 1000 Paris, and ATP Tour Finals without losing any round-robin matches. Since Zverev has played 14 tournaments already this year (not including Indian Wells), he can count points from 5 more and the Tour Finals, so, all the points I have him hypothetically gaining here would be countable. That means that we can take Zverev's current point total of 4915 and add the sum of all these gained ranking points to it: 4915+3500=8415.

I'm aware of the Covid ranking adjustments but as far as I know, that doesn't impact the breakdown of events, it just allows players to include some 2019 and 2020 results if they are better than the 2021 results (and even that has begun to phase out since the 2021 Cincinnati Masters). But this doesn't seem to be the case in certain players' rankings breakdowns.

63,tennis,Andy Murray is going to domesticate Alexander Zverev,"Alexander Zverev sure is ready to punch his ticket to the Indian Wells quarter finals later today. Many have tipped it to be a physical battle and his¬†training regime appears to have¬†been adapted accordingly, given the thunderous activity sounding from his hotel¬†room. Sparring partner Nikoloz Basilashvili was only scheduled to stay an hour but it seems both have lost track of time ‚Äì and boundaries, as a mistimed diving¬†slam almost sends the Georgian¬†through the ceiling below. Good thing the other guests were evacuated hours ago. 

Alas¬†for Andy Murray in the next-door room, he missed the evacuations, having been sat on the can¬†all morning¬†playing Metal Gear Solid. It‚Äôs only when a particularly intense somersault kick¬†sends¬†some plaster crumbling down onto his mobile screen that he finally removes his headphones. In his hurry to escape the vicinity, he accidentally flushes his wedding ring down the toilet, which he is now desperately trying to retrieve before the roof caves in. He¬†hasn‚Äôt felt this much danger since he and Kim sat down to watch Lorenzo Sonego‚Äôs home birthing tutorial. 

Meanwhile,¬†the players‚Äô downtime tour of California state didn't go much better. Things didn‚Äôt get off to a great start when Emma Raducanu fired the tour guide after¬†five minutes, while Lorenzo Musetti suffered¬†a breakdown¬†after seeing an Instagram update¬†from his ex-girlfriend.¬†Naomi Osaka had to be ejected after calling in the paparazzi¬†five times along Route 66, and¬†the outrage was palpable upon finding former Delray Beach finalist Donald Young‚Äôs star had been stolen from the Hollywood Walk of Fame.¬†Carlos Alcaraz got lost on the way to San Francisco, while¬†Boris Becker sadly got left behind in Vegas, somewhere between the Strip and the wedding chapel. 

Becker will at least have company in the casinos tonight -¬†in the form of Dominic Thiem, who has been hitting the tables hard amidst the pain of being¬†unable to¬†defend his Indian Wells title this year. From poker to blackjack, wheelbarrow racing to projected sales of Radek Stepanek‚Äôs 2022 calendar ‚Äì there's nothing he won‚Äôt place a bet on. Wrist injuries are never easy, and Kevin Anderson can certainly empathise ‚Äì he required reconstructive surgery on his¬†after all the autographs he had to sign following Sunday‚Äôs win over Sonego. Rumour has it he will be playing left-handed against Monfils later tonight. Which is probably still one hand more than Zverev will be able to play with, if his sparring session doesn't end soon.¬†",1634055701

93,tennis,Some young players you should know about -- part II: new ATP names for 2021,"I found [this post from the archives](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/jaeczi/oc_some_young_players_you_should_know_about/) on a random search a couple of weeks back. That post, presenting several promising youngsters to look out for, was written on October 12th 2020. The original poster has since deleted their account, but I thought it would be fun to do a one-year follow-up anyway. Part I, on ATP players, is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q0koy8/some_young_players_you_should_know_about_2020/).

In this second part, I'll be highlighting my own selection of up-and-coming youngsters on the men's side. Each player will have tags (Country; Age in format years.months; current (live) ranking at time of posting; Junior ranking J## if appropriate). Everybody on this list is under 20 at the time of posting. Three of the players mentioned below are also on [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/pktjic/the_nextgen_the_best_players_born_from/), where u/Saxyman76 discussed the ""next gen"" and in particular the Top juniors.

With any luck, I'll be able to follow up on these players in another year or so, and see how I got along! It has to be said, though, that on the men's side breakthroughs tend to come later, so it's likely to be some years before many of these players come to wider notice assuming they do go on to break through. This also explains why a lot of the ATP players on the list from last year are still (Alcaraz aside) competing mainly at a lower level.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

**ATP**

**Juan Manuel Cerundolo** (Argentina; 19.11; 103): Perhaps including somebody that is about to break into the Top 100 is not exactly a hot take, but Cerundolo makes this list anyway because he arguably could have made it onto last year's list. At the time (October 2020) he was ranked just inside the Top 350, and 2021 has been a pretty decent year. One ATP 250 Title on debut, along with three Challenger titles, has propelled Cerundolo around 250 places in the rankings. This isn't the first time Cerundolo has been noticed by r/tennis: see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/ncux0z/next_gen_of_the_week_2_juan_manuel_cer%C3%BAndolo/gy75los/?context=999) by u/lostinmoss for a recent and more detailed evaluation, which also provides reasons why we maybe should not expect him to rise to the very top. Also, all the titles mentioned above have come on clay. Still, being sixth on the Tour among under-21 players is no joke. Currently playing in the Santiago Challenger, needing two more match wins to break the Top 100.

**Luca Nardi** (Italy; 18.2; 442): One of several youngsters who presumably made a decision to leave most junior competition behind comparatively early. Whilst still 16 he picked up a first ITF title, and has won two more this year, bringing him well into the Top 450 (from 800th seven months ago). Started to pick up match wins at Challenger events, including his biggest yet against Yuichi Sugita, ranked at the the time just outside the Top 100. Most of his success so far has come on clay; it will be interesting to see if he's capable of playing well on other surfaces. Expect to see him inside the Top 300 at least before too long.

**Arthur Fils:** (France; 17.4; 672; J6): One of only two under-18 players in the men's Top 1000, and  the highest-rated, the losing finalist in the 2021 Boys' French Open has recently started playing adult matches, with two ITF Men's semi-finals and one final to his credit so far. Despite losing to Luca van Assche (who appears next in this list), he's had a little more success transition to the adult tour. Breaking through at any level on the men's tour as a 17-year-old is rare, and I wouldn't be surprised if we hear more from at least one of Fils and van Assche. I just don't know *which* yet.

**Luca van Assche** (France; 17.5; 682; J4): The second of three under-18 players in the Top 1000, and the recent Boys' Singles French Open Champion. Hasn't had as much success on the adult circuit as his fellow Frenchman Arthur Fils (whom he beat in the final), but there aren't many other youngsters who have come close to breaking through yet. Last week he had a nice run at an ITF tournament, making the semi-finals in Nevers and lifting him to his highest-ever live ranking. 

**Shang Juncheng** (China; 16.8; &gt;1000; J1): The current Junior #1, Shang is also still only 16 and much younger than most of the boys rated below him. That is already a promising sign. No Junior Slams titles yet, although his ranking is justified by his remarkable consistency: QF at the French, SF at Wimbledon, and the Finals at the recent US Open, along with three high-level junior titles this year. What's more, he recently played in, and won, an ITF Men's title in Fayetteville (in his first-ever main draw ITF appearance!), while in his first senior-level match he took Liam Broady, ranked 158th at the time, to three sets at the Miami qualifiers. It may well be a while before we see if this potential leads anywhere, but boy is there plenty of potential here! Very briefly appeared in the live Top 1000 last week, and has a chance to make it official this week.

Honourable mentions:

**Daniel Rincon** (Spain; 18.9; 983; J2): 2021 Boys' singles US Champion who has only recently started playing ITF-level tournaments. Finally breaks the live Top 1000 for the first time this week, but a comparatively late breakthrough.

**Federico Cina** (Italy; 14; J555): A 14-year-old appearing in the Juniors Top 1000  is something of a feat itself (there are only four currently). Cina recently won his first junior title and got to the final of a second. Also the [losing finalist in the prestigious Petits As 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q2ohth/les_petits_as_2021_boys_final_highlights_federico/). The victor of that match, **Maxim Mrva**, may also be worth mentioning, but hasn't yet made the transition to the ITF Junior tour. Anything bigger is a long way off, but an impressive start.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

That concludes this list. Has to be said, it's been hard to find new names to add, partly because the ATP list from last year was so comprehensive, and also because it typically takes longer for men's players to break through to the top. But hopefully some of the players above will turn out just as well, given a couple more years or so.

20,tennis,"Abuse, lies, plagiarism: it shows the ugly side of tennis (Simon Graf article about Ben Rothenburg translated from German to English)","His research into alleged attacks by Alexander Zverev against an ex-girlfriend triggered an investigation. What makes the world's most powerful tennis journalist tick?

Alexander Zverev is playing an excellent season, became Olympic champion in Tokyo and is gradually working to meet the high expectations he has aroused with his talent. But a dark cloud hovers over the German: the abuse allegations of his ex-girlfriend Olga Sharipova, with whom he was together from September 2018 to October 2019. The 24-year-old Russian claims she was repeatedly beaten by him. Because of the physical and psychological violence against her, she even tried twice to kill herself by injecting an overdose of insulin.

US reporter Ben Rothenberg followed up on her allegations, which first circulated in Russia, and made them public for the first time less than a year ago and stuck to the story. Zverev has repeatedly denied the allegations and taken legal action. The case has been simmering in the background for a long time and divides the tennis scene.

The Laver Cup, the event organized by Federer manager Tony Godsick, blocked anyone on Twitter who posted anything about it, as Zverev was one of the most important participants. Well-known TV commentator Mary Carillo even withdrew from the event because she did not want to be silenced.

Now the ATP, the association of professional male players and organizer of the tour, has taken action and has launched an investigation. ATP managing director Massimo Calvelli said: ‚ÄúThe allegations against Zverev are serious. We have a responsibility to get to the bottom of them. We hope that our investigation will allow us to establish the facts and take the appropriate action. ""
He welcomes this step, said Zverev in Indian Wells. He would have wished for it a year ago because he suffered from the allegations.

For Rothenberg it is a satisfaction that the ATP is now active. If the freelance tennis reporter, who also writes for the ""New York Times"", hadn't worked through this relationship drama in a journalistic way, this would hardly have happened.

He came across the affair on social media: ""I saw an Instagram post from Sharypova in Russian and wanted to find out what was behind it,"" he said in an interview during the US Open. His stories are as fluid as his texts - it just gushes out of him. ‚ÄúThen I found out that she was in New Jersey, so very close. I met her and when I listened to it I thought it was a story worth writing down.‚Äù 

He published the first part (‚ÄúOlya‚Äôs Story‚Äù) in November 2020 in ‚ÄúRacquet Magazine‚Äù, a magazine that appears four times a year with carefully written background stories about the world of tennis. The second (‚ÄúEvery day, I was crying‚Äù) in late August in the online magazine ‚ÄúSlate‚Äù, which belongs to the ‚ÄúWashington Post‚Äù. Rothenberg had carried the follow-up story around with him for eight months, had it checked by fact checkers and lawyers, before he published it four days before the start of the US Open.

That Rothenberg researched Sharipova's accusations in detail and wrote them down is typical of him. The 34-year-old from Washington is known for digging up the awkward stories many of which keep hands off. In doing so, he polarizes the scene. Some find that he is a polluter who makes a name for himself at the expense of others and knows no consideration for losses. Others admire his courage and welcome the fact that he wants to shed light on the ugly sides of the glamorous world of tennis. He's a mix of tennis nerd and journalistic pit bull.

As a child he was a big tennis fan, says Rothenberg. His father took him to the final weekend of the US Open several times as a teenager, around 2000, 01, 02. ""At that time the Williams sisters dominated, I was a big fan of them,"" he says. At some point he began to debate tennis in fan forums, then he started his own blog (‚ÄúThe Daily Forehand‚Äù). This is how he got his first accreditation for tournaments, and the New York Times soon hired him as a freelancer.

Whether you like him or not, Rothenberg has already triggered a lot in the scene for his comparatively young age. The first story of his that made waves was the one in July 2014 about the plagiarism of the renowned and award-winning Times journalist Neil Harman. These appeared in the official Wimbledon yearbook, which Harman had hastily written since 2004 following the championships.

Harman was the face of the English tennis journalists. Jovial, always in a good mood, welcome everywhere. He played golf with Rafael Nadal, drank coffee with Stan Wawrinka, joked with Roger Federer. But then he became arrogant. For several volumes of the Wimbledon yearbook, he copied entire sections from other newspapers - without citing the source. From the Guardian, the New York Times, the Sports Illustrated, the Telegraph, the Independent. What intellectual property theft is.

This was also heard by the Wimbledon officials, which is why they informed Harman in spring 2014 that he would no longer write the yearbook in future. That would probably have settled the matter if Rothenberg had not meticulously proven all plagiarisms of the 2011, 12 and 13 yearbooks on ""Slate"" (""Unforced errors"", ""More unforced errors""). The sum is astounding, as is the audacity with which Harman copied. He even made mistakes. Two days after Rothenberg's first article, the tennis reporter was released from the Times and subsequently dismissed. He has not had access to the All England Club since then.

Doesn't that arouse sympathy with Rothenberg, who brought down Harman with his stubbornness? ‚ÄúThis story wasn't easy for me because we knew each other from the press room,‚Äù says the American, who has been a journalist at Grand Slam tournaments since 2012. ¬´We were on friendly terms. I had nothing against Neil personally. But the story had to be told. There were many British reporters just waiting for someone to do it. "" Harman has not found a job in journalism since then and wrote some sports books.

The consistency with which Rothenberg runs through his stories once he has decided on them shows his understanding of journalism. He doesn't just want to write beautiful stories, he wants to look behind the scenes and trigger something. He says: ‚ÄúIn this sport, so many things happen behind closed doors and in areas that we don't know about. On all levels of human existence. We only understand this world superficially.‚Äù 

In August 2018, for example, Rothenberg portrayed the Estonian Rainer Piirimets (‚ÄúLosers‚Äô Lunch ‚Äù), who moved at the lower end of the tennis ecosystem - and in half-legality. Piirimets worked as a courtsider, as an assistant to professional bettors. His job was to follow the game on site and to provide his clients with information about the score faster than the live score or to report if a player had health problems. A lot of money can be made with online betting with this knowledge advantage.

Courtsider is a demanding job. You have to be wide awake, recognize early on when a ball is going out of bounds (before it hits the ground), and watch the players closely. Then there is the constant fear of getting caught. Because the tournaments don't want courtsiders in their stadiums. Piirimets was handcuffed at the 2017 US Open and had to spend

Such stories are what fascinate Rothenberg. Or that of Darko, who posed on social media as a 20-year-old exceptional talent from North Macedonia who had just woken up from a coma and now wanted to conquer the ATP tour. Instead, the story conquered the online universe, Darko's tweets in which he condemned homophobia or racism were shared thousands of times, even Serena Williams, Martina Navratilova and the BBC fell for him. That shows how easy it is to spread fake news. And what influence social media have.

With almost 100,000 followers on Twitter, Rothenberg has become a power factor in tennis itself. The players know that too. Novak Djokovic, who felt attacked by him, involved him in a nine-minute verbal exchange of blows during a press conference in Rome in May 2019. ""I'm not looking for such confrontations,"" says Rothenberg. ‚ÄúBut I'm not afraid of them either. And I was very curious what Novak had to say to me.‚Äù

The extroverted Australian Nick Kyrgios repeatedly reported against Rothenberg on social media - until he talked to him for 50 minutes for his tennis podcast (‚ÄúNo Challenges Remaining‚Äù) in spring 2019. They have liked each other ever since. Perhaps because they discovered that they are similar, unwaveringly going their way without looking left and right.

""It was only when I heard Nick speak so openly that I really realized how much everyone else is holding back,"" says Rothenberg. He would like to tear down this facade. In any case, he won't run out of stories that haven't been told or that very few people want to write.

I am a 1.85cm and 90kg guy with strong constitution. I am also particularly good (for my skill level) with top spin.

I am thinking on either the Aero G or the Pure Aero (Rafa style racket is my main requirement :)).

I know that for my level and for the next 2 years, the Aero G is more than enough, but: Why not buying the Pure Aero now instead of in x years?
I am sure I will take this sport seriously and in some point of time I will buy a high-end racket so buying the Aero G feels like throwing money away.

What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

I voted for 2. I think he'll win AO and Wimbledon. AO is Djokovic's best Slam which he has won the last 3 times in a row. His motivation should be high as he is chasing the stand-alone Grand Slam titles record. I think he'll also win Wimbledon because he remains far ahead of the competition on grass. The next-gen has really struggled there so I don't see anyone else winning it. The only way I see Djokovic not winning Wimbledon is if he has a serious loss of motivation after achieving the GS record.

I remember back in the day when Tennis magazine was a bit bigger than it is how. Does any subscribe to any sources? Racquet seems like the less frequent cultural look at the sport. The Racquet substack is solid for technical analysis. I wish The Athletic covers tennis.

24,tennis,"If you aren't mad at yourself after missing most shots, whether in practice or in a match, you don't have the killer instinct.","I get frustrated almost every single time I miss a shot, unless it's almost unreturnable but I manage to get to it. I probably get most frustrated when I do something that destroys a rally when I'm practicing, missing a shot I should get in (my practice partner doesn't give a shit, but I'm swearing and beating myself up in my head). In matches I'm a little less hard in myself because I know I'm playing against someone, not for someone (hope that makes sense). Still, I'll swear in my head, but erase every thought from the previous point. Hell, I don't remember over half of the points I play. Something about watching a practice partner pick up balls is something that really kills me, even if we had a great rally. 

Anyone else feel this way? I'm constantly told not to be too hard on myself, but I cuss and feel like I don't belong on the court for like 10 seconds, then I forget what the score is since you can't change the past and was taught not to dwell. 

It's really fucking weird, partly stressful, but I grew up in a time when swearing wasn't offensive.",1633776012

47,tennis,Conspiracy theory: Federer is faking his injury to stay away from the media so he doesn't need to address the Zverev allegations,"Think about it, Federer was obviously pretty close with Zverev, who was even in Federer's Team 8 agency. The one time Federer addressed those issues he was criticised for not being clear/harsh enough. Now he's still earning millions (90 million USD in the past year, equal to Serena + Novak + Rafa combined), while not even playing. 

So why not maintain that reputation and marketability which stands to earn him hundreds of millions more, far more than what he could earn on court?

Fed and his team have done an incredible job throughout his career of maintaining his image, marketability and popularity with fans (to such an extent that 8-7 40-15 still lives on in my head rent-free, even though he's a billionaire spending his down time skiing on the Swiss mountains while I'm stuck in lockdown with 62 cents in my savings account).

For example what did he do differently against each player e.g. what did he do differently against Murray and Berdych in the SF and F respectively in W. Furthermore, what did he do differently on each surface like what tactics did he implement on Clay compared to what he did on Grass  and Hard court? I would like some insight. What are your thoughts?",1633649125

I recently bought both Top Spin 4 on my PS3 and Tennis World Tour 2 on my XSX and while they both have the same gameplay features, Top Spin 4 still plays more realistically than a current gen game. The graphics may be outdated but the way the players themselves move still feels more realistic than the robotic movements of the current games. 

I wish we could get a new game, even if it‚Äôs made by EA, with the same level of quality that‚Äôs put into the FIFA games.

55,tennis,[OC] Visualisations of how Nadal's backhand has performed against (and been targeted by) Djokovic across their matches at Roland Garros,"Thought I'd make this to test a theory I had. First of all, here is the number of shots Nadal has hit from his backhand side in each RG match vs Djokovic (I added Rome 2011 as well as this was a year Djokovic dominated Nadal, but they didn't play at RG).

&amp;#x200B;

[Djokovic targeting Nadal's backhand more recently](https://preview.redd.it/y09uew6l11s71.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdf6670a94c8ce937c119ef114d5f7b7cea83f3e)

It shows how **Djokovic has targeted Nadal's backhand way, way more in their past 2 Roland Garros meetings**, to the extent that Nadal has been hitting over half of his shots on his backhand (although I think inside-out forehands also count as backhand side). The number of backhands in 2015 was interesting, and reflects maybe a lack of confidence from Nadal in that shot.

The second chart is Nadal's backhand performance in these matches. There are 2 plots here: unforced errors divided by winners (you want a low number here), and overall % of backhands which were an unforced error.

&amp;#x200B;

[Nadal's relatively rubbish backhand in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/4kqtx44i21s71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f44ceacae92921d24ae42f063b67e4ed062028)

There are a few things that stood out to me from this. Firstly, **Nadal was amazing in 2020**. Despite his backhand being targeted all match, he made almost no errors and actually hit more backhand winners than UEs. Secondly, **his backhand was very poor in the 2021 match by his standards -** it essentially broke down under Djokovic's game**.** He hit *32* *unforced errors* to 4 winners, and 1 in every 10 backhand was out. 

The question is, will Nadal try to find a way to keep the points on his forehand more, or trust that he can produce another 2020-esque performance? Or will Djokovic continue to benefit from his clear tactical decision? So it'll be interesting to see what happens when they next play on clay.",1633612753

1. Tsitsipas
2. Zverev
3. Medvedev
4. Ruud
5. Berrettini

Tsitsipas is my pick to win it because IW plays a lot like clay, which is his favorite surface. The slow and high bouncing conditions help him a lot because it gives him time for his backswing and compensates for his poor return of serve. The high bounce also brings the ball up into his ideal strike zone. Tsitsipas has been pretty underwhelming since RG, but I think that'll change here. Zverev is my 2nd favorite because he's been very good at Masters this year, having won 2, and the conditions should benefit him because he prefers higher bounces. Medvedev is my 3rd favorite because although he's always fantastic on hard courts, the slower and more clay-like conditions at IW could give him trouble. Ruud is my 4th favorite because he's in-form and clay is his best surface. Finally, Berrettini is my 5th favorite because he's already been to a Masters final this year (Madrid Masters lost to Zverez) and he's proven himself to be very good on slower surfaces. He did well at RG and Madrid Masters so there are reasons for optimism. However, I don't think he's good enough to get past the 4 players ahead of him mainly because of his vulnerable backhand.

Leylah got very upset (complaining pointing fingers) which in my opinion was very unsportsmanlike. I understand its a GS final, but Emma had no choice as she was bleeding out. Idk if its just the pressure of the game that got to Leylah to act out this way or some sort or entitled mindset that she had going in to the final (as she beat osaka and sabalenka) that she acted this way as an excuse for losing.",1633494915

I know basically nothing about strings and rackets which is why I am asking.

The strings I was using at the start (I forgot the combination) were breaking every 2-3 times I would play so in like 6-8 hours which I am not playing to go pro or anything so that is just too expensive. The people I play would be like ""again already."" The person at my tennis place just kept changing it to increase the durability until he couldn‚Äôt do anything that would make it last any longer. Despite that, I continued to break it in around 6-8 hours. I then went to a different place to see what they suggested and they restrung it and added some super tough material (I don‚Äôt know what it is exactly) and now it has lasted a while but it sucks to hit with. It is like hitting with a frying pan.

I want to see if there is a racket or string option anyone in here could recommend that wouldn‚Äôt break fast? I recently tried a Yonex and really liked it that was around the same weight as my burn but don‚Äôt want to run into the same issue.",1633465017

52,tennis,I miss Justine Henin.,"Justine Henin was such a magnificent tennis player. There is so much to like about her game. Of course, there's her ATP style forehand which, while often eclipsed by the beauty of her backhand, was one of the biggest weapons on tour during her time. Justine, of course, was small and she had to consistently go up against insanely powerful hitters like the Williams sisters, Davenport and others. Her forehand was so good at dealing with all that power, and doing so while staying close to the baseline. She stalked the baseline (I recall her, almost menacingly, saying ""my baseline"" during interviews) and refused to give an inch to the bigger, stronger women. It was remarkable to watch her go toe to toe with anyone, fighting off huge powerful shots with her own power and finesse. 

Then of course, there was that backhand, and it was such a sweet shot. Of course, during Justine's prime, the one handed backhand in the women's game wasn't nearly as rare as it is now, but in my opinion, she hit a better 1hbh than any other woman, ever. She could blast passing shots on the run with it. She could come up with sweet, powerful angles when pulled off the court. She could take the ball early, neutralizing power, just like with her forehand. She could slice and dice her opponents into utter frustration. Her forehand was the bigger weapon, but you could write a book of poetry just about her backhand. 

Justine also had quite a powerful serve. While her first serve percentage was often fairly low, she frequently came up with huge first serves at clutch moments, which was all the more remarkable considering her height. Like Ashleigh Barty, Justine was able to use every inch of her small frame to come up with huge, clutch serves. 

Her net game was magnificent. For anyone who watched it (and if you haven't, you should) the 2006 Wimbledon final was an absolute masterpiece of grass court tennis. She may not have won, but Mauresmo and Henin put on an absolute master class on serve and volley tennis in that final. Throughout her career, Justine was an aggressive, all court player whose volleying skills haven't been matched by anyone in recent memory, save the aforementioned Amelie Mauresmo. Her complete all court style, I'd argue, hasn't been matched by anyone in the women's game since she left the game (presumably) for good. 

Lastly, how can we talk about Justine without acknowledging her mental strength. This woman was just so determined to win each and every point. I watched her 2003 USO seminal against Capriati live, and she fought, clawed and scraped her way to that victory. She was cramping, the crowd was mocking her, Capriati was throwing everything she had at Justine, and Henin refused to wilt. She closed out the match in a 3rd set tiebreak after 3 plus hours, reportedly couldn't walk and needed fluid injections after the match, and then went out and won the final in straight sets two days later. Absolutely remarkable. 

This diminutive powerhouse squeezed every ounce she could out of her frame and managed to win 7 majors in the era of ""big babe tennis"" and she did it with a style and flair that hasn't been matched since. 

Now, I must confess, during her prime *I did not like Justine Henin.* She was the villain to me. I found many reasons to dislike her. I found her cold, her pleading looks to her box annoyed me, I refused to forgive her for ""the hand"" or for retiring in the 2006 Aus final. But what really upset me, to be perfectly honest, was that she was just so much better than my favorite players at the time. She beat my favorites, consistently. And that pissed me off. Now, I can only dream of a woman playing tennis the way she could in this day and age.

The team with the LOWEST score was declared the champion for that year. The list of champions can be viewed at the bottom of the doc.

11,tennis,What would your ideal ATP policy against domestic violence look like?,"With the ATP announcing they are investigating Zverev, and the increasingly sporadic discourse of that topic, I though it might be productive for us to talk about what we'd like to see the ATP do moving forward. Before anyone accuses me of having opinions which I don't, let me state them plainly:

* I strongly lean towards believing Olya's story, because I strongly lean towards believing women in these issues
* I have no more or less evidence regarding the matter than any of you

With that in mind, **if you could wave a magic wand** and institute what you believe to be the perfect domestic violence policy for the ATP to take, what would it look like? In my mind, it needs to address these key truths:

* The vast majority of these accusations are credible and serious, and women who are victims need as much support from all angles as possible
* A small, likely tiny amount of these accusations may be false, as there have been documented cases of this happening to professional athletes
* The ATP is heavily incentivized to punish bad actors for the good of their brand and their sport
* The ATP, while not a true union, ultimately works with and on behalf of the players. And rules and regulations they put in place need to be largely approved of by the players
* The ATP has no legal teeth to demand anything of anyone in any ""investigation"" they conduct,  though it is possible that this hypothetical domestic policy could make it mandatory for players to turn over records, texts, voicemails, etc. if they face accusations. But this would still only apply to the players. 

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this, and how the sport might be able to do the right thing. What kinds of punishments are we looking at under your hypothetical policy? Are players being forbidden from training? If so, how are they earning money during ongoing investigations? What is happening to their ranking points? Curious how everyone would like to see it handled.",1633368081

70,tennis,Some young players you should know about 2020 -- where are they now? Part I: ATP,"I found [this post from the archives](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/jaeczi/oc_some_young_players_you_should_know_about/) on a random search a couple of weeks back. That post, presenting several promising youngsters to look out for, was written on October 12th 2020. The original poster has since deleted their account, but I thought it would be fun to do a one-year follow-up anyway.

Because this is going to be quite a long post, I'm splitting it into three (or possibly four) parts: ATP youngsters to watch from the 2020 list; the same for the WTA; and then a new list of names to look out for in the future. In both the first two, I'll cover all names the OP mentioned, in the order presented: those who had already broken through, all the highlighted young players, and the honourable mentions, which I'll expand upon. Each player also has tags (Country; Age in format years.months; ranking on the 12th October 2020 list; ranking on 4th October 2021 list). Hence, for example: 

**Lorenzo Musetti** (Italy; 19.7; 143; 61) 

makes him 19 years and 7 months old, ranked 143rd on October 12th 2020, and is 61st on the 4th October list.

If the original poster has a new account and wants to chip in again, please be my guest! I wish we knew who they were: as will be especially clear in the WTA post, they've proven to be something of a brilliant visionary.

**2020 (and earlier) breakthroughs**

**Lorenzo Musetti** (Italy; 19.7; 143; 61): Since last year, when he had a breakthrough at the Rome Masters before picking up a Challenger title, Musetti has climbed steadily up the rankings, with his best 2021 results undoubtedly coming at Acapulco, losing to Tsitsipas in the semis but beating Schwartzman and Dimitrov on the way, and Roland Garros, where he took a two-set lead over Djokovic but had to retire. Since then, he's had a difficult run, losing seven out of his last nine matches played, in part [due to personal difficulties](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/q0gpek/musettimy_private_life_hadnt_been_nice_lately_i/), but has reached a career-high ranking of 57 recently. Also, no further titles this year mean that he still has some way to go before establishing himself as a top force. Not yet 20, though, and has clearly built on last season! Let's hope the barren run from the last few months ends soon, especially now he's been working with a psychologist to overcome his difficulties.

**Jannik Sinner** (Italy; 20.2; 46; 14): Sinner's inclusion on the 2020 list owed a lot to his victory at the 2019 NextGen Finals, as well as his run to the Quarter-Finals at the 2020 French Open. That saw him reach the Top 50. His first two 250 titles, at Sofia and Melbourne, soon followed, as well as a run to the final of Miami, and his biggest title yet at Washington in August. Just this week, of course, he's defended his Sofia title. Sinner has certainly lived up to the billing, and has surely got plenty more to give. With the absence of Nadal, and perhaps even Djokovic, from the Tour Finals, Sinner may even have a shot at making the Finals himself, especially if he can put together a run at Indian Wells.

**Young Players to Watch**

**Carlos Alcaraz** (Spain; 18.5; 158; 38): OP suggested that hardcore tennis fans should perhaps already have been aware of Alcaraz last year. I reckon every tennis fan on the planet knows about him now. His 3R victory against Tstsipas at the US Open was surely the match of the tournament, and given everything else that was going on in that fortnight that's some feat. What's more, he built on it by winning his next match too, before injury ended his run. When OP included Alcaraz last year, he also pointed out that Carlos had won two Challenger titles at 17. Literally the very next week, Alcaraz made it three, added a fourth just after his 18th birthday, and won his debut ATP Tour title in Umag in July. With such impressive results as a teenager, and such a wonderful style of play too, it's hard not to be excited about ""the next Nadal"" Alcaraz's future.

**Jack Draper** (UK; 19.10; 295; 277): It's safe to say that 2021 has been a quiet year for Jack. His most notable achievement is beating Sinner and Bublik at Queen's, and at Wimbledon he was able to take a set off Djokovic. But outside that, and one final at an ITF event, it's been quiet. Not everyone can enjoy as spectacular a rise as Alcaraz, though, and it may be that injuries have played their part in shaping his 2021, since four of his matches this season have ended in retirement. Hopefully, 2022 will bring greater things.

**Tseng Chun-hsin** (Taiwan; 20.2; 284 ; 254): As with Draper, 2021 hasn't been a great year for Tseng. One ITF title in August might have given him the confidence needed to put together another few decent runs at Challengers recently, though, as he very recently made the Top 250. No tour-level appearances to speak of, for the former two-time Junior Grand Slam winner, and it remains to be seen if he will rise any higher.

**Harold Mayot** (France; 19.8; 415; 443): Don't be too put off by the apparent backwards movement. Mayot's 2021 season didn't even begin until August, presumably due to a long injury lay-off. Two semi-finals at the ITF level since then actually doesn't seem too bad in that context! If he can stay fit next year, then maybe we'll have a fairer chance to assess his prospects after a full 2022 season as opposed to this year's very truncated one.

**Holger Rune** (Denmark; 18.5; 551; 124): After three ""misses"", at least for now, OP finally has another hit! Rune ended 2020 and began 2021 by making deep runs at ITF events, picking up three titles. His Tour-level breakthrough at Santiago followed (reaching the quarter-finals), along with his first three Challenger titles. A couple of decent runs at 250 events, and of course his debut Slam at the US Open -- another player in this list to take a set off Djokovic -- will have got more people's attention. What a year for the Dane! Already a climb of over 400 places in the rankings in a year, and I'd like to think we've found another key name for the future of men's tennis.

**Shintaro Mochizuki** (Japan; 18.4; 711; 400): A Junior #1 at 16, Mochizuki chose to play only adult-level tournaments since 2019. Has had some impressive results this year, the stand-out being qualifying for the Miami Masters. I'd also add to that his first ITF final in August, and a decent performance at a recent Challenger has seen his ranking climb to the Top 400. A long way to go, and no titles at any adult level yet, but a solid 2021 season all the same. More to come? Hard to say, but very much going in the right direction.

**Honourable/Special Mentions**

**Eliakim Coulibaly** (C√¥te d'Ivoire; 19.5; 1710; 640): Highlighted last year mainly for being a tennis player from a country without much of a tennis tradition, this wildcard pick hasn't disappointed either! Only started his 2021 season in March, and remains at the ITF level, but has won two titles and reached a further final to climb into the Top 650. I don't know if we can expect much from his future, in particular because he's basically confined to playing in Tunisia right now (his one match outside Africa, in France, ended in defeat). If r/tennis wanted to [sponsor a player](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/ph3ahy/two_weeks_back_the_seed_of_an_idea_to_sponsor_a/), though, I'd love for it to be this guy.

**Martin Damm** (USA; 18; 895; 623): The first of two honourable mentions. Briefly a #3 Junior, and with perhaps a promising doubles career also (four ITF doubles titles, and a career high of 355), Martin has recently picked up a maiden ITF title. Turned 18 a few days ago, which is the only reason he's no longer the highest-ranked under-18 player on the tour. Hard to assess his future, and is some way behind his fellow 18-year-olds, but may yet be worth keeping an eye on.

**Arthur Cazaux** (France; 19.1; 923; 342): The second honourable mention, Cazaux's fine junior career included victories over most of the players on the list above, including Alcaraz and Rune, and his overall record at Juniors against the field above is 8-4. His best junior result is the AusOpen final in 2020, losing to Mayot. As an adult, Cazaux has progressed rapidly up the rankings, primarily on the back of some decent performances at Challengers and ITF events, with one ITF title in December 2020. He's also beaten a few Top-100 players, including Korda and Mannarino. Currently the 11th-highest-ranked under-20 player, and third-youngest in the Top 350. Definitely earned his place in last year's list.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

That concludes the run-down of ATP players featured in last year's post. As can be seen, there are four definite hits (Musetti, Sinner, Alcaraz, Rune); four players who have done pretty well for themselves, even if they have not yet broken through (Mochizuki, Coulibaly, Damm, Cazaux); and only three ""misses"" in Draper, Tseng, and Mayot. And those last three have got plenty of time to improve. Not a bad performance for our mysterious u/\[deleted\]!

1.  Into his 5th final of the year. (1 less than Djokovic)

2. Beat his second top 5 player in Andrey Rublev this week. Previously beat Dominic Thiem in Lyon. Both were the top seeds in the respective draws.

3. Has beaten the British No.1 Dan Evans twice this year (Australian Open and San Diego)

4. Got his first ATP tour title in Los Cabos where he took advantage of ""weaker"" draws due to the Olympics

5. Started the year at number 74 in the rankings before climbing to a career high of 28 this week.

All this is made more impressive by him predicting that HE will have a breakout year when asked in this interview below:

My backhand is so solid that I don't even practice but still I can fall back on it anytime any day. Forehand is completely a different issue. No feel at all. I tried many different things with different techniques but none worked. I think that affected my somewhat decent forehand. Actually, there was this one time where I felt that I finally got my forehand but that lasted only a week. I think playing matches ruined it. Since then, my forehand has become worse than ever. It deteriorated gradually though. I was able to consistently hit over the net but I wasn‚Äôt feeling on few shots. Now, it's so bad that I can barely hit over the net. I used to be a solid 4.5 NTRP at my peak. I am even worse than a beginner right now. It‚Äôs even worse than when I started playing. And I have realized that I've developed bad habits all of a sudden. I can shadow swing properly but when playing on court, everything feels so off. No weight transfer, not moving forward, playing too stiff or too close, connecting the ball late or too early, and most importantly no feel at all. I definitely shortened my back swing. In short, it's so terrible that I feel like quitting the most passionate thing in my life. I get nightmares thinking about my forehand. I don't feel like hitting with anyone because I would be just wasting their time. Thinking of investing on coaching for a few sessions. Any suggestions? Thanks for reading.

2) Serve-Bot: You now have Isner's serve. 

3) Golden Returner: When someone is serving at you, time slows down to half speed. Only works when returning serves.

4) The Flash: You have Nadal's movement from 2005. 

5) Energizer Bunny: You never get tired. You play the every set with as much exhaustion as you play the first point of the match. No deep breathing required.

6) Doctor's Choice: You cannot get injured or sore, no matter what you do during the tennis match. 

7) Peer Into Depths: One second before your opponent hits the ball, you know exactly where the ball will land after they hit it (seeing the future).

8) Flat World: You can choose to shoot the ball with absolutely zero spin, completely flat.

9) Coach's Delight: You never get frustrated, annoyed, or lose focus. You have a perfect mental game. 

10) Mr. Accurate: You can choose exactly where the ball will land after you hit it, but your shots are 30% slower than normal. Doesn't work on drop shots.

11) Not my fault: You never fault on a serve, but nothing else changes. 

12) Net hero: You get the combined volley skills of McEnroe and Federer. 

13) Ambidextrous: Your weak arm is as good as your strong arm. You can have two forehands. 

14) Genius: You gain the shot selection and strategic skills of a 20-year veteran tour veteran.

15) Hawkeye: You gain the ability to know whether a shot is in or out with perfect accuracy.",1633223634
99,tennis,I've read conflicting reports of whether the new vaccine mandate in Victoria applies to the Australian Open or not.

But this other article (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2021/10/01/ashes-australian-open-competitors-require-full-vaccination-refused/) says ""England cricketers and the world‚Äôs best tennis players face being banned from the Ashes series and Australian Open if they failed to get fully vaccinated against coronavirus by the end of next month.

5,tennis,Tennis media and fans should treat ATP Finals appearances the same way the NBA treats All-NBA selections,"All-NBA and similar awards in the US sports are a great way of keeping track of history and acknowledging players who were at the top of the game, even if they weren't necessarily MVP calibre or NBA champions. Tracy McGrady was a tremendous NBA player, and even though he never won an MVP or a title, a new fan would know he was great just by quickly glancing over his 7-All Star and 7 All-NBA appearances. Right now, tennis places a premium importance on the slams, partially (IMO) because there just isn't much prestige placed on any other areas of the game (other than maybe a couple of the older Masters tournaments). Making the Finals is a massive achievement no matter how you get there and I think we ought to place a higher emphasis on guys and girls who make it. Maybe the tour could invent a new term for it and mention it as an accolade in broadcasts; eg. Nikolay Davydenko was 5-time All-ATP, Casper Ruud and Jannick Sinner are chasing their first All-ATP appearance etc.

Its obviously a very small thing but I just think it's a really simple way to better acknowledge and recognise those who were at the top of the sport for a full season, even if they didn't win a slam or finish as year-end no.1 and one that would be helpful for new fans who want a better perspective on players who've come and gone.",1633211882

17:31 - the role of a good serve, and the importance of backing up your serve

20:03 - the importance of getting depth on groundstrokes

21:15 - whether the Big Three represent the best era of tennis ever, or whether the nextgen are weak, and whether comparing eras is even productive or not *(imo this section alone is worth the price of admission)*

24:50 - whether the expectations for the nextgen are unreasonable

31:00 - how the homogenisation of playing surface speeds has worked against the nextgen

32:20 - what makes a great coach, and what players should look for when choosing one *(again, great discussion)*

36:13 - the shifting momentum in long-running rivalries and how that happens *(this is where Lendl and McEnroe really have at it with their bantering)*

26,tennis,I built an app to automatically edit my tennis match videos,"Recently, I have been getting back into tennis and started recording my matches to look back on but I found that I rarely ever actually watched them back. It was tedious with lots of dead time of collecting balls, clearing the court, taking water breaks etc. I also didn't know the score of the match when scrubbing through the video.

To solve this problem, I decided to develop an application to automatically cut out the dead time in my tennis match videos and overlay a score board. You film the match as normal but also log each point, serve and other events as you play. This logging can currently be done from an iPhone or Apple Watch. The iPhone application can then be used to automatically edit the video; cutting it down and adding a scoreboard.

I have a working prototype and plan to release a more complete version of the app if there is enough interest. You can find out more and register your interested on [www.racketreel.com](http://www.racketreel.com/).

||Djokovic|Federer|Nadal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|US Open (12)|Australian Open (15)|French Open (14)|
|2|French Open (11)|Wimbledon (13)|US Open (8)|
|3|Wimbledon (10)|US Open (10)|Wimbledon (7)|
|4|Australian Open (9)|French Open (8)|Australian Open (6)|

If you compare these rankings to their rankings in Grand Slams by titles won in each, you find some very interesting differences and similarities. Djokovic's are probably the weirdest. Despite the Australian Open being Djokovic's most successful Grand Slam by titles won, it is his least successful by semifinals reached. And Wimbledon, his 2nd most successful by titles won, is his 2nd least successful by semifinals reached. In fact, his 2 least successful Slams in terms of titles won (USO and French Open) are his 2 most successful Slams in terms of semifinals reached. In contrast, Federer's favorite Slams by semifinals won are very similar to his rankings by titles won. The only difference is that the Australian Open and Wimbledon are switched. Nadal's are exactly the same. The Slams where he has won the most titles are also the Slams where he has reached the most semifinals, in the exact same order.",1633148157

50,tennis,why is it so hard to play like roger federer?,"I know this is stupid of me to ask, because obviously I don't have his God-given talent, but why is it so hard to imitate Federer? I videotaped myself playing tennis a couple weeks ago and (I know, I know, this is stupid of me to even *think* that) I thought I would look a little like Federer, since I use a one handed backhand too and copies a lot of his moves, I looked NOTHING remotely like him. It's awkward, grotesque, and clunky. (I'm no kidding when I say I watch tennis clips on YouTube at least 2-4 hrs a day, with 80% of it being Fed)

This also reminds me of hearing even other professional players saying that ""everybody"" tries to play like Federer but no one ends up playing even remotely like him. So...just want to start this conversation somewhere, why is it so hard to copy him, even though it looks so simple? Players from Dimitrov to Tsitsipas to Thiem and (by his own admittance) Alcaraz tried to incorporate part of Federer's game but none would even come close to his ease and elegance.

I think its like when people say people tried to write like Hemingway but couldn't get close to it, even though he wrote in such simple proses. Food for thought, anyone?",1633138411

Just wondering which of those matches did it seem like Federer had a real shot going in, or his best shot?

In 2005: Federer was the best player in the world, had beaten Rafa in Miami that year and it was Rafas first slam.

In 2006: There first grand slam final against each other, Rafa had beaten him 4 straight matches (their last one being a 5 set classic in Rome) and Federer won the first set 6-1, then lost the next 3 sets.

In 2007: Federer had finally beaten Rafa a couple weeks before at Roland Garros, lost in 4 again.

2008: Even Federer admitted he didn't go into that match thinking he could win, probably not this one.

2011: Federer just ended Djokovics unbeaten run, had a set point at 5-2 in the first set, and the first 3 sets were insanely close.

2019: Probably not this one either, so much wind, Rafa said given the conditions would have been hard for Federer to have an imprint on this match.

Seems like it's definitely 2005-2007 or 2011. Wondering if there was a time going in to the match or during any of these it really seemed like Fed had a chance but he just lost it.",1633043499

""Initially, the preservation of intimacy was a common posture among us, but it stopped being after the non-payment of exorbitant amounts that were demanded of me so that the breakup did not turn into a publicly defamatory campaign against me. This crime of which I was a victim. it is already being duly verified by the competent authorities"", added the current number 2 in Brazil in the ATP ranking.
""In relation to the disdainful statements about me, I have to clarify that they are defamatory and libelous practices that are also the object of civil and criminal proceedings already underway. Although we are all far from perfect, I am happy to say that these false allegations, fabricated and vindictive, they are in no way a reflection of my character or actions,"" added the tennis player.

""After the brief clarifications on this particular matter, which I deal with with great seriousness and sadness, their negotiations will again be conducted strictly in the private and judicial sphere, as the preservation of the intimacy of others is also a posture that is expected of good people"", he added the player, who responds to action for material and moral damage, filed by Thayane.

You look at me through the prism of the world around you. You only see what you want to see, without looking into the palaces of my mind. Talk to me about something that interests you. You compare with others, forgetting that everyone is different. You know me, but you don't know me at all! Open your eyes and look into mine: there is life and thoughts that are not spoken out loud. There I wait for you to see the real me in all this farce of madness. We are all so alone because no one knows or sees us.

Three weeks in China is beyond my strength.
The body is already giving sos signals.
The face poured out like never before, the throat hurts, weakness and from time to time the body seems to be electrocuted.
Air, water, food: everything is disgusting.
At the same time, I do not lose weight, but as if I am swelling and swelling.

People themselves burp, spit and it seems that they are not shy about anything in this life.

A few months ago, we asked you to participate in an online survey on personality in the context of sports. After recruiting participants, we spent the last months analyzing and interpreting the collected data.

Now, we would like to inform you about our first findings. We wrote two reports - one on each main research question. Because the reports are written in German and quite long, we made short summaries in English for you. Because we cannot upload a pdf-document on Reddit, we added a docdroid link that guides you to our results.

Thanks again to every single one of you who participated in the survey and contributed to getting more insight in personality in the context of sports!

I am, and was, absolutely baffled how he changed his game during that span; it's felt fishy....he couldn't hit a winner against the big 3, then all of a sudden starts smashing the ball unlike he's ever done before?

I'm sure I'll be downvoted, but it was such a change I can't imagine it being ""natural.""

I won't lie, since Nadal was out during the same period and came back and won basically everything gives me pause. But Nadal was always a top tier player during that era, unlike Murray.

It's always been something I wanted to get off my chest because the change was so drastic I have a hard time to believe it was a natural evolution of his game.",1632986998

84,tennis,Unpopular opinion: Nadal history with injuries is exaggerated,"Since 2005, he has never left the top 10. Something that no other player has done before. Also, something that is impossible to achieve if you miss a full season and more (I.e. Del Potro).

He has also won 10 or more titles in many Masters 1000 and obviously 13 of the past 16 roland garros. Numbers that are only possible if you are 1) an active player every year, 2) in good shape at some point every year.

With this I don't want to diminish his injuries or career. In fact, I want to highlight how consistent he's been over 16 years (!) compared to all other players.

Of course he has had many injuries every other year but we can't compare them to other injuries that leave you out of shape for years (again, like Del Potro). He has been present in approximately every clay season which has allowed him to make impressive records like the ones mentioned above among many others.

I would bet on Iga mainly because she's the best clay courter out of all the youngsters atm. Plus her game can be adapted on hard court and grass.

I spoke with someone who has a used playmate, $2000 new, bought in 2016 only used 4-5x. They're asking $1500.

Issue is, the lobster elite one or elite liberty both sell new for $1400-1700 depending on specs and model.

I hate to low-ball someone for an offer but I just feel like I don't want to pay new machine price for a machine that whole lightly used probably will need battery update and others changes plus the usual risks of buying used (I'm taking them at their word it's barely been used).

1. What do you think is a fair offer to make the person for the playmate? I doubt they'll come down to $1,000 but if I'm gonna get a used one for $1200 or more I don't see why I wouldnt just buy new at that point for a little more.

2. Difference between lobster elite liberty and elite one is 70 mph Max versus 80 and elite one has longer battery life. How worth it is it for slightly higher mph and battery?

4. The server‚Äôs partner did not attempt to get the ball, leaving it for the server to field.

62,tennis,I find the ATP Next Gen really boring,"The more of players like Medvedev, Tsitsipas, Zverev I see, the more I think the ATP is gonna get boring as shit. Every rally these days is just a grind, Medvedev hits a huge serve, and is really tall but somehow also has amazing movement, and good ground strokes; Zverev is the same; Tsitsipas is another grinder but with a worse serve. Speeding up the courts just makes serving more unbeatable. And like, what‚Äôs the solution? Banning the tall? Fuck no. The worst are players like Van de Zandschulp or Ruud who don‚Äôt have the same serve, but can grind as well. But players like Ruud are not new, RBA and PCB are also monotonous grinders.

The real issue is these big guys, with huge serves, good movement, and big groundstrokes, the grind is so boring. I mean, not every match can have the versatility of Federer - Djokovic on fast hard, but God, I expect more than one viable style.   


Is this just gonna be what pro men‚Äôs tennis is like for a while? Cause if so, I ain‚Äôt watching it much longer. Once you‚Äôve seen prime Djokovic, you‚Äôve seen the best grinding - I don‚Äôt find ND boring because I think he‚Äôs the best counterpuncher / grinder, and I like watching the best. The WTA for example, has no serve hegemony, and thus more playstyles. (I think faster courts on the women‚Äôs side would be amazing, as the servebotting problem the men face isn‚Äôt an issue.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I want men‚Äôs tennis where grinders, net rushers, serve and volleyers, incessant drop shot abusers , shotmakers, slice gods, and hammers can all win. I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible on the men‚Äôs side.

&amp;#x200B;

Majors: Australian Open (cheerful but mainly respecftul crowd, amazing venues, excitement for the first big tournament of the year, amazing country and city).

Masters 1000: Madrid (love the late spring-ish feeling, the fast pace of playing thanks to the altitude makes it a very peculiar clay court tournament, the courts look amazing, especially Estadio Manolo Santana).

ATP 500: Vienna (often a key tournament to grab points late in the season, it had some really exciting finals in the last 6 or 7 years, it has a simple but very cute looking venue).

ATP 250: Montpellier (I don't watch ATP 250 tournaments very often, but I always watch this as it's the first tournament to fill the void and the need of tennis after the Australian Open. The venue looks quite good too for a small tournament).",1632840173

79,tennis,What are your tennis unpopular opinions? I'll start.,"1. Djokovic's matchups with similar style players like Murray, Simon, Zverev, Medvedev, RBA and so on are actually rather exciting instead of boring like most people seem to think. These players can match him in terms of consistency and with their ability to suffer in long baseline rallies, so watching them and Novak try to figure out ways to puncture each other offensively (i.e. with serve, net play, forehand, drop shots) when the rallies get too long and physical to sustain is very interesting.
2. Federer's backhand is more enjoyable to watch than his forehand. Pure technical bliss.
3. Marat Safin = Nick Kyrgios in terms of style/demeanor. Well, similar at least. 
4. Margaret Court doesn't deserve many of her 24 grand slams. If anyone deserves to be called a weaker era champion, she does. As does Rod Laver to an extent.
5. Hyeon Chung, had he not run into all the injury woes he had, would have been the next big thing. He was the answer to Djokovic in terms of movement but he actually had a big forehand which most of the younger generations of today lacked.
6. Women should play BO5. More precisely, men should play BO3 in the first four rounds of a grand-slam, and in the final stages, play BO5. So should the women. 
7. Doubles should be given more screen-time/watch-time. It's an underrated part of tennis.
8. Rafael Nadal's backhand defence was as good as Novak Djokovic's in his prime on hard courts. Not better by any means, but as good.
9. Monica Seles, had she not suffered that horrific stabbing, would have been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, female tennis players of all time. She could match and even beat Steffi Graf at slams, was super consistent in terms of results, and had the game to dominate the tour at a level only matched by Graf, Williams and Evert/Navratilova. 
10. Andy Murray, if he had a better or more devastating forehand, would have beaten Novak Djokovic in at least one of the AO matches they played (they played in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016 and he lost all), and would have had a chance to beat Djokovic in that French Open final they played in 2016. The way the matches went is that too often, Murray would try to outlast/outgrind Djokovic, which worked on occasion (like in their 2012 match), but Murray just wasn't as good a grinder as Novak. He would get tired out by the end while Novak would be jumping around like a jackrabbit because of his more devastating forehand which ran Murray around the court, tiring him out while he was fresher because he did less running.
11. Zverev is a fucking tool. Not sure why so many people like him as a player/person.
12. Women tennis players don't deal with slice all that well. We have to state it at a point. It comes down to the fact that they don't get down with their forehands and generate enough aggressive topspin like a Thiem or Nadal on the men's tour can. Not sure why? I think Chris Evert once summarized that it comes down to the fact that women have less pronounced/strong forearms and hips, possibly to do with the fact that they are for childbearing. Please don't flame me in the comments over this, Evert is right. It's basic biology.

Do you agree or disagree with any of the unpopular opinions I've written here? Please let me know in the comments. Also, what are your tennis unpopular opinions?",1632826311
80,tennis,Grip size L2 to L3,"Hi,

I've recently bought a new racket. I used to play with grip size L3 and a Wilson pro overgrip. The total circumference was about 11.7 cm and this felt perfect for me. The new racket was only available in grip size L2 and I figured I could increase the grip size by buying [this heat-shrink sleeve](https://www.tennis-point.be/gamma-griffschlauch-verpakking-1-stuk-zwart-1457380006200000.html). I removed the base grip, applied the sleeve with a heat gun, applied a new base grip and a new Wilson overgrip. The problem is that the circumference is now 12 cm and feels too large.

I tried to solve the issue by removing the sleeve and applying an extra thin overgrip with a Wilson overgrip, which came to a perfect 11.7 cm. However, now I cannot feel the bevels enough for my taste.

Is it possible that the sleeve I bought was simply too thick? Or can I solve this issue another way?

82,tennis,Fake Big Four,"I just realised there are 4 players that I have mistaken for members of the Big 4. No, I don't mean Wawrinka, I mean people whose names are very similar to those of Big 4 members.

21,tennis,Insight into Monica Seles,"I was reading Youtube comments on a Seles youtube match video. One user had some enlightening comments on her career trajectory. Do you all feel as though this person had any valid points? See below. 

I hate to barge again into this choir. But it is high time to dispel this rampant common belief: No, it was not the knife that punctured Monica Seles' teenage triumphant success. This is a common fallacy that is easy to believe because it's simple and vivid. The wound was a very light one, and didn't do any serious damage. It required only two stitches. Monica Seles never displayed a photo of the wound, nor later was she willing to show a picture of the scar. A journalist once asked her, tongue in cheek, to remove her shirt and let everybody see the famous scar. She published all the medical reports on her assailant G√ºnther Parche. But she never published her own medical reports from the surgeons in Vail or from the psychologist in Lake Tahoe. The German lawyers had no difficulty proving that  the injury was slight, and Parche‚Äôs intent not deeply criminal.  Yes, Monica Seles could have been killed, or, even worse, paralyzed. But she didn't. She just got immensely lucky. The two surgeons in Vail thought she could be back in action in about 5 months. And her brain circuits, those that control the dynamics of her shots were not destroyed either. Her hard hitting style didn't disappear at all. Look, she even won her next (and 9th) grand slam right after her return from a 28-month withdrawal. An unexpected win which, by the way, proved to be another piece of good luck for her. 

What destroyed her was her emotional reaction, her unbalanced interpretation of the incident, her incessant convoluted ruminations on all the aspects of the stabbing and its complex consequences, her obsessive lamenting about her tragic fate, and her sinking into a pervasive depression ‚Äî all the classical signs of a PTSD. She was left mired in months-long sulking and feeling sorry for herself that turned into years. The physical wound was nowhere as serious and debilitating as the depth of her mental upset. The higher you climb, the harder is the fall. She felt her life had suddenly been utterly shattered. Young Monica never considered counting her blessings, how lucky all her life had been, including escaping any serious injury from the stabbing attack, being transported two days later by private medical plane across the Atlantic all the way to Vail, getting examined immediately by top doctors, and all those great wonderful things tennis and America had brought into her life. 
Monica had come to believe she lived in a tennis wonderland where she had become de facto the princess of the game, winning practically any grand slam tournament she entered. And, lo and behold, without her the tennis world was now still going on, and very well. That was oh so grossly unfair, so she felt. There was a mistake somewhere that she couldn't accept and tried in vain to rectify mentally. So everybody in the game was now acting as if she no longer was that important, right? No longer a dominant force on the Tour? No longer entitled to the No. 1 ranking? So she was going to show them and quit this game that didn't value her as highly as she deserved. It was to be their loss, they'll miss her and the brilliance and excitement of her play once she was gone. She was behaving, without knowing it, like Nixon when he resigned; or Achilles raging in his tent, nursing his personal grievance and refusing to  join the  Greek army besieging Troy. Again, Monica was acting in a well-known, standard psychological play of anger and resentment, of moaning, moping and sulking, like the spoiled child she in fact still was.

She stopped practicing ‚Äî a fatal decision of self-sabotaging. Not even going out for walks, simply sitting on the couch glued to the TV set, learning English from cartoons, forgetting her mental pains by stuffing her face with the ordinary junk food from neighborhood stores. Over those two long years of bingeing she gradually managed to lose her adolescent gaunt frame and join the ranks of vastly overweight Americans. That was Monica Seles's only visible sign of finally embracing American culture.

The Flying Wallendas, famous German-American high-wire artists, have a key, imperative rule: After a fall, immediately, get back on the wire. Don't let fear paralyze you. If Monica had reacted more normally, like an adult with mettle and courage ‚Äî like Petra Kvitova would after a more serious knifing attack later on in 2016 ‚Äî if she had gone back to the court as soon as feasible, and drowned her sorrows in 6-hour hitting sessions, she very well could have competed in the 1993 US Open, and probably also in the Year-end WTA final at MSG.

No, it was not the knife that stopped Monica Seles, it was her being lost in a fantasy of being the unique queen of tennis without whom the tennis world had no right to go on. Her list of grievances was longer than Achilles'. The Hamburg tournament had continued after the stabbing as if nothing had happened! Her No.1 ranking was not maintained in her absence from the WTA tour! The German courts accepted the defense of G√ºnther Parche's lawyers and let him practically go free! She was losing her sponsorships and endorsements to her competitors! They now were winning all those other Grand Slams that were her due! How could that  be? Her whole world was crumbling down. Why did everything suddenly turn away from her, abandoning her, the superstar of the  tennis world? How was all that nightmarish sequence of disasters possible, right after her sensational series of triumphs?  It was 19-year old Monica's lack of maturity, her juvenile disappointment and day dreaming that fed a growing depression and stopped her phenomenal career in its brilliant tracks.
Everything had been going so magically well for her until now, she had been living in such a fairy-tale as if protected by the gods, that she never had had the chance to face adversity and build up any fibers of resilience. All true tennis champions have had their ups and downs, their personal tragedies. But none underwent the kind of radical metamorphosis in mind and body that became Monica‚Äôs strange, Kafka-style, fate. Always the odd case, she was the only one to go off the deep end and lose control of her sanity and figure, and to abandon training. Unlike Agassi, who revealed the depth of his troubles in his gripping memoirs, or Sharapova, who survived childhood poverty and a career-threatening 15-month suspension due to a failed drug test, or Kvitova, who suffered a far more serious knifing attack, or Venus Williams, beset by medical problems, Monica alone simply let herself drown into her psychological and physical collapse. She had never learnt how to swim in a sea of troubles.
It was also, in an inseverable part, a result of the sad resignation and lazy laissez-faire of a father/coach, already enfeebled by cancer, who was too lenient and permissive, too worried about damaging his beloved daughter's fragile mental balance ‚Äî his reluctance to crack the whip in order to bring her back to reality, to remind her that there were no ways she could hope to remain a towering champion without discipline and hard daily practice, above all maintaining that winning 118 lbs figure, and working tirelessly on mobility and endurance. 

This return to reality eventually happened, after 28 months of absurd moping and irrational withdrawal. The hitting style was still there, but the full strength and amazingly sharp precision of her shots could not have survived intact after such a long inactivity of her essential muscles. Impossible to imagine, and sad to contemplate, but sylph-like 117 lbs Monica had been metamorphosed into an obese player soon to balloon up to 175 lbs in 1997, in some kind of grotesque ‚Äúsumo wrestler‚Äù caricature ‚Äî the only unprecedented and aberrant case on the professional women's Tour. Nothing was ever normal in Monica Seles‚Äôs career. With that new incarnation came reduced mobility, and loss of reliable endurance in long matches. In the cold light of tournaments, the new Monica no longer was the same dominant star she had been during her four years of teenage glory. Try as she might, it proved for her impossible to recover the fine-tuning of her former prodigious form. And, through the torturous mistreatment she inflicted on her young body at such a critical age ‚Äî  rapid and forced yoyo-like up-and-down gyrations of weight ‚Äî she may have suffered some invisible damage to the very engine of her vitality (heart, kidneys, lungs, bones, feet, etc... who knows, such things were never revealed). All this radically eliminated her chances for the extraordinary record that could have been hers.

Again, once and for all, it was not the knife of the April 30, 1993 stabbing in Hamburg that did the undoing of Monica Seles superstar. It was the immature mind of an ignorant adolescent who had never learnt anything about the real world except hitting tennis balls against a wall and whatever her adored and adoring dad had been drumming into her from their overly secretive and distrustful Hungarian cultural background. He cultivated Monica‚Äôs passions for hitting tennis balls, and cleverly fed her love of fun and excitement with his cartoons, turning every practice session into a playful game. No strict disciplinarian, he didn't inculcate his young daughter with a taste for regular workouts nor surmounted her profound dislike for running and other athletic training. He neglected developing in the young girl the so-called ""executive function"", exercising the frontal lobes of her brain in charge of keeping control on her impulses, taming her wild instincts, and focusing on building up efficient habits of personal life management. 

She sabotaged herself, trusting nobody, including experts, sharing her anxiety and fears with no one, behaving exactly like an uneducated teenager who persistently lived following the unpredictable cues of her own extreme emotions and unchecked weird imaginations ‚Äî from which Monica Seles probably never completely escaped.

The great enigma. Revisiting thirty years later this sensational ""mano a mano"" between those two juvenile promoters of the power game in women‚Äôs tennis, ‚Äî a truly historical match of fighting passion where the two adolescents keep pouring all the boundless energy of youth into every shot ‚Äî there are the same two vexing questions that keep again spontaneously haunting the mind of a fervent admirer of teenager Monica Seles's so brilliant and exciting play. 
That this young Monica had been an extraordinary player, a breath of fresh air in the stultifying atmosphere of serve and volley, and abuse of the boring sliced backhand was obvious to all during Seles‚Äôs glory days from 1989 all through 1993. But that she reappeared in 1995, at the still young age of 21, as a markedly diminished player was also sadly obvious to everyone in the tennis world. 

How and why did young prodigy Monica Seles come to put her remarkable, unique, revolutionary talent into hibernation in a Sarasota storage room, drop out of competition and practice at a most critical time of growth for what seemed like an eternity, to reemerge on the court having lost the fantastic sense of precision, the tremendous accuracy, and good endurance of her triumphant days and become relegated into the handful of players struggling to maintain a spot in the top-10 rankings? How and why did this superior, dominant, phenomenal talent degraded so much and nearly vanished so dramatically? 

And this abrupt change, lamented upon by all, became ever since an intriguing challenge to commenters and experts alike. They were all eager to exercise their journalistic perspicacity and delighted with the opportunity to expatiate at great lengths to make sense of what appeared to have been a real metamorphosis. They were not always assisted by the fuzzy explanations of the new Monica, a young woman raised in the tightly-controlled old Yugoslavia, and addicted to keeping her secret thoughts to herself. Thinking clearly and expressing her feelings convincingly had not been anyway the forte of the giggling, bubbling, and gabbing youngster, still poorly educated, unsure of her words in English, and emotionally fragile. 
This remains the nagging enigma that any reflecting observer still finds disturbing and perplexing. But also fascinating, and perhaps, thirty years after the facts, worth taking a little more time to investigate, research thoroughly, get a closer look, and, who knows? hopefully elucidate. The owl of Athene takes her flight at night, when the battle is over, and the bodies can be counted.",1632768496

It likely won't get any better. Most of the Team Europe lineup will likely dominate the next decade of tennis while the big Team World performers of Kyrgios, Sock and Isner will likely decline. World does have some promising talent, but I don't think it matches Europe's offerings.

44,tennis,Keep hurting my back playing tennis,"Maybe this is the wrong sub for this question but since it is tennis related maybe others have had the same experience. 

I am currently in lockdown and have been for 2-3 months, working from home and 90% of my time is now spent sitting down at a desk. The one thing I am able to do is exercise which for me means playing tennis. After each time I play now my back gets really sore, particularly my lower back near my tailbone, which I have been putting down to letting my back lock up due to sitting down for so long. I have a decent office chair with support, stretch every day and before playing. Has anyone had dealt with this and found a way to alleviate it?

Worth noting, before lockdown I was fairly active and this didnt really happen, although I was fairly prone to pulling a back muscle on occasion say on a dodgy first serve or something. I have started doing some daily abdominal exercises to keep the area active which has helped a good amount but not completely. It might just be time to see a physio.",1632650666

52,tennis,"Are The Tennis GOATs, Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, the Greatest Athletes of All Time","First of all, tennis is my 2nd favourite sport, my first being basketball so any bias i may have i consider minimal. If you just think about the GOATs from all across sports, Jordan/Lebron in basketball, Brady/Rice in Gridiron, Messi/Ronaldo from football, Gretzky in hockey, Phelps in Swimming etc. I think the GOATs of tennis, being Djokovic, Nadal and Federer are the greatest athletes ever. First of all, tennis is an individual support, you rely on urself to win and you do all the work by yourself. You win because of how good u are and not anyone else. Furthermore you compete the longest out of any sport, making it one of the most taxing sports if not the most. Now if you just use the averages of those 3's accomplishments its 20 Grand Slams, 33 masters 1000s, 4 ATP Finals. I mean thats just ridiculous if you compare it to the other GOATs in their respective sports. I mean just think about the amount of points you need to win a match, then you need to win a match 7 times to win just ONE grand slam. These guys have done that 20 times and thats just the grand slams. Think of all the points needed to win those 37 masters and ATP' finals. Oh and I haven't counted the amount of 250s and 500s they've won so add that in their as well. Now i know some people, or most, don't have that much knowledge on the other GOATs i mentioned beforehand but trust me, they definetely did not win THIS much. I know people will say ""oh tennis has way more opportunities to win"" but even so these 3's accomplishments to me surpass every other GOAT even when taking that into account. And one of the MOST important things I haven't mentioned is that their doing this in the same time as each other, winning more than anyone has ever before. I mean imagine just placing say federer in the 80-mid 90s, nadal in the mid 90s- 2010, djokovic in 2010-now, theyd prolly have like 30 grand slams 50 masters 1000s and so on because they wouldn't be in each other's way. Its just kind of ridiculous.",1632636178
53,tennis,I (a 1HBH player of 15+ years) played a practice game tonight where I returned with a 2HBH - omg I'm never going back.,"As my skill has improved I find myself playing opponents with stronger serves, and I've noticed that it's so freaking difficult to get my racket in front of me on a 1 handed backhand return.  In addition, if you mistime it, you'll shank it into the fence. 

Whereas the guys I play that have 2HBH's often times shank the shit out of it, but because they have two hands on it they're able to frame it back into the court.  

I used to hit with a two hander for maybe a year like 10 years ago, so I have the mechanics somewhere in my brain.  But holy hell.  I haven't hit a two hander since then and tonight my backhand return game felt so much better doing a two hander. 

Which kind of pisses me off.  

Like, how the fuck can I work on a shot for 10 fucking years, only to try a new shot and within 60 seconds it's better than the 10 year old one (for returns at least.)

Give me time to set up on a 1 hander and I'll molest it.",1632632045

56,tennis,Should Team World be embarrassed ?,"I know that this is just for fun and it has no impact on points but do you think that they should be embarrassed? I think they might even laugh it out at themselves because this tournament is just a stomp. It‚Äôs not that bad if they just lose but Team World has been hyping up points and just giving us teasers only to lose it at the most crucial times ( FAA, Isner, Diego, Doubles) along with the bagel as well from Shapo  (which is team Worlds number 1 seed lol). Also notable mention from Opelka and Kyrgios. 

No hate just friendly discussion because I do think Team World wanted to win because of what Zverev said as well being the last point they would win. But it‚Äôs also good to put into account that most of Team Europe is just simply in form. You have Ruud coming off a beast clay season winning 3 titles in a row and catapulting to 10 rank and Medvedev winning Us Open along with Zverev coming off that olympics + masters win. But even with Rublev, Berrettini , Tsitipas, they have had very good seasons compared to Team Worlds‚Ä¶.

 Diego losing to a unranked in Davis cup. Isner , kyrgios barely in form and Shapo , FAA not consistent as well. Opelka also can only win against people who can‚Äôt return his serve and everyone on Team Europe are excellent returners.

It was just funny to me because I really would‚Äôve liked it to be close but it was more just a teaser and the more they lose the more I just thought that maybe it‚Äôs just because that it‚Äôs unlucky cause Team Europe are crazy in form right now.",1632630313
57,tennis,Pro Staff RF97 Autograph for a 4.5,"I'm a 4.5 NRTP considering getting the autograph, partly because I'd like to get it as an heirloom before he retires. Typically a 4.5 shouldn't game something as advanced as the autograph, but here's the catch. I play with a 2014 pure drive gt, which is an already stiff racquet at 72 RA. In addition, I've added tungsten putty to the handle to the point where it weighs 345 grams and is 11 points head light. I also have alu power strings at 59 lbs, and these changes have been quite gradual, I've found I get the right control and power from them. So far the biggest difference between my current setup and the autograph is the autograph is slightly heavier and a little less stiff. Thoughts?",1632630179

72,tennis,What should I upgrade my racquet to?,"I've had a Head Spark Pro racquet for almost 4 years now, and I want to upgrade. I tried using my friend's Ti.S6 and it didn't feel very good. It has a thicker frame than the Spark Pro, and I prefer the thinner frame on my racquet. I've been looking at the Wilson Blade 98, Yonex Ezone 98, Head Radical/Instinct/Extreme/Speed, and I'm not sure what a good choice for me would be.


Even though I've had the racquet for 4 years, I've only cumulatively played for a couple of months. My shots don't have a lot of topspin, but I enjoy the 16x19 string pattern anyways. I enjoy hitting a one-handed backhand more than two-handed. My backhands have some spin but my forehands don't. I use a shock-absorber and like playing with it better than without.

Europe has 6 of the top 8 players in the world on their team, World's highest is FAA at 10. Were Garin and DeMinaur not invited? How is this going to be even mildly competitive.

Is John McEnroe the only ex-US player available to be Captain? How about we get Agassi or Courier or even Andy Roddick as Captain?

44,tennis,Dominic Thiem interview - says Stober refuses to admit wrong treatment; decision about surgery on October 4th,"# Thiem on the Stober case: ""Twisted the truth"".

**Dominic Thiem describes the separation from physiotherapist Alex Stober in the ""Krone"" interview. The tennis star chats about his injury, the decision day in October and other rumors.**

[https://www.krone.at/2515689](https://www.krone.at/2515689)

**""Krone"": Dominic, how is your hand?**

Dominic Thiem: On the 28th I get the splint off, October 4 is the decisive day. That's when the wrist will be subjected to a stress test, including the extreme positions it's in when playing forehand.

**""Krone"": And if it goes well, can you start training again?**

The hand will then have to rest for another two to three weeks, but I will work on my fitness the fullest. I have lost muscles, must look that the right arm becomes a real sleeve again. But if the test doesn't go well, surgery will be necessary.

**""Krone"": How long would you be out then?**

Then I would not be able to train properly until February or March instead of November. So it would only be a few weeks, but it would cost me the Australian Open.

**""Krone"": The healing process didn't go according to plan, did it?**

I had the injury diagnosed by a specialist in Barcelona. He explained that the hand absolutely had to rest. But my physio Alex Stober said that it was the discus. He started to treat the discus, because he also thought that the US Open could be possible. And so I myself also had this hope. So I picked up the racket again much too early. And the wrist snapped again ...

**""Krone"": And was that the reason for your breakup with Alex?**

No, we had six great years in which he made me super fit. It was a mistake, but mistakes happen. What bothered me was that he didn't admit it, twisted the truth by claiming that I had pushed to get fit for the US Open. That destroyed the basis of trust.

**""Krone"": But you initially claimed on ServusTV that there was no separation ...**

I wanted to protect Alex with that. I wanted to talk to him personally after October 4, that would have been important to me. But then everything came out somehow.

**""Krone"": It was said that you had also separated from fitness trainer Mike Reinprecht?**

That's not true. He's still with the team alongside Jez Green and is always on call when I need him.",1632566892
45,tennis,The Rublev Rant: Part II,"The first part of the Rublev Rant ended up being kinda vague, mainly because it was late and I started to fall asleep, so I kinda just lamented Rublev's game and lack of strategy, but I want to get more in-depth with it. To do this, I want to first look at Rublev's matches against next-gen opposition who he really struggles with, mainly, world number two and US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, and world number four and US Open chokeian Alexander Zverev. Then, I want to talk about the best strategies Rublev could employ.

**Daniil Medvedev**

Watching Rublev - Medvedev clashes fascinates me. Rublev hits the ball hard, but almost aimlessly. Points with Medvedev break down into three major categories (excluding aces, unreturned serves, and double faults.)

1) The Grind Point. In this point, Rublev will hit down the middle for a while, hit a middling shot cross court, then aggressively go cross court. Rublev is hesitant to ever change direction, and when he does, he frequently makes errors, or he hits a bad error. The second way this point ends is with Medvedev setting up angles that disrupt Rublev's rhythm; Rublev either ends up near the net, where he's completely out of position to do anything but watch Medvedev hit a passing shot winner OR Rublev manages to retrieve the volley, only for Rublev's volley to either suck or go out. On rare occasion, Rublev will find his confidence, and can hit a big down the line shot which can Medvedev on the defensive, from here, there's still no guarantee, as if Rublev gets up to the net, there's a good chance he seriously fucks up. But, most of the time, Rublev does manage to win after a big down the line BWEH shot. The Grind Point works for Rublev about 20% of the time, but because of Medvedev's better physical fitness and movement, Rublev's grind points get progressivley poorer, and wield diminishing returns.

2) The Nervous Point. Here, Rublev will just keep hitting down the middle, with a lot of power. A lot of the times, against Medvedev, even with easy winners, Rublev will just hit the ball down the middle, allowing Medvedev to hit an angled shot or a lob to force Rublev to defend himself, from here, Medvedev is in control of the point, and will use controlled aggression to eliminate Rublev from the rally procedurally. Alternatively, Rublev will keep hitting down the middle, while Medvedev drags Rublev around the court - the most frustrating thing, is that Medvedev gives Rublev angle-opportunities, which Rublev just doesn't take.

3) The Octopus Point. This is a point where Medvedev serves, or gets a big return. Once Medvedev asserts an early dominance over the point, Rublev just has nothing; Medvedev uses variety and angles, with some drop-shots and pace changes to basically exhaust Rublev before eventually winning the point.

Rublev's serve and lack of positioning + mediocre return and nervous points are exploited by Medvedev, leading to the Russian Bear pulling out the victory, barring weird cameras.

**Alexander Zverev**

Interestingly, what happens to Rublev against Medvedev also happens to Rublev against Zverev. Like, literally, I feel like Rublev - Medvedev and Rublev - Zverev are the same exact matches. Rublev plays his grind point, and his nervous point, and Zverev has his equivalent to the Octopus Shot. Rublev's nerves, lack of positioning, and serve + return are still exploited.

**What Rublev Needs to Improve:**

Confidence, volleys, drop shots controlled aggression.

**Some Good Strategies for Rublev:**

1) The triangle pattern. Rublev already uses this sometimes, but against big opponents, he could employ the triangle pattern, whih focuses on controlled aggression. Basically, it works like this: Rublev hits forehand cross court, then hits to the other side, and he just keeps going back and fourth. This point is great, and he already uses this a bit, but more is needed than just power to optimize this strategy. A lot of times, your opponent, if you use this method, will end up hitting a weak shot, and once at the net, one should be able to end the point - this is where volley improvement is huge.

2) The drop shot. Adding this change in rhythm is great. The drop shot lob combination is brutal, and against big opponents, very effective. Grinding with Zverev and Medvedev is futile, so Rublev needs to change up points, adding drop shots, slices, and confusing short angles are all very good. 

3) Be crazy! In every match, Rublev should do a bit of serve and volley, chip and charge a second serve,  rush the net a couple times, just stop being so predictable. Rublev's opponents can basically always expect what Rublev will do, which is a major liability. Adding some crazy points should help.

**Immediate goals for Rublev: controlled aggression, shotmaking, confidence**

**Next couple seasons: Net game, slice**

**Long term: Game plan and analytical skills.**",1632566733

75,tennis,The Rublev Rant,"I first discovered Andrey Rublev during the 2019 US Open, when he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas, followed by eliminating Nick Kyrgios to make the fourth round. The first ever Rublev performance I saw was his match against Kyrgios; Rublev won in three passionate sets: 76(5), 76(5), 63. Immediately, I identified upsides, and downsides: he had good aggression, but not nearly like he does today, and his volleys, second serve, and slice were non-existent, not to mention how painfully mediocre his backhand was. 

I ebulliently followed Rublev as he ascended, winning Qatar and Adelaide, I watched as Zverev eliminated him at the 2020 Australian Open, and once again, I couldn't help but notice that he was just being outclassed: Zverev had a bigger serve, less power, but strangely, bigger weapons, better variety, and somehow, even a better (or really, a less worse) second serve. When the tour kicked up again, I watched as Rublev lost to Medvedev in the US Open quarterfinals, despite a six to zero lead in the first set tiebreak. Medvedev ground Rublev, neutralizing Rublev's one dimensional game viciously and effectively. 

The latter half of 2020 would bring Rublev his first ATP 500 title, followed by two more in quick succession, Rublev would reach the quarterfinals of the French Open, where Tsitsipas - whom Rublev had edged out in Hamburg, just a week before their French Open clash - outclassed Rublev. Rublev ascended into the top eight, bursting into the ATP Finals, where he was promptly outclassed by Nadal, and mentally imploded against Tsitsipas, before winning against a Thiem who didn't even want to try. Rublev ended the tournament, and the year, ranked number eight, joyous, optimistic, and saying, at the conclusion of the year-end finals, ""I am the one who cannot complain."" 

I watched excitedly as Rublev obliterated his competition in the ATP Cup, toppling competent opponents such as Fognini effortlessly. Once again, Rublev would be outclassed by a fellow next-gen player in the Australian Open, with Medvedev delivering the kill this time: once again, Rublev's power was neutered by Medvedev's defense and return. 

Rublev then obliterated the field in Rotterdam, hitting with the greatest power of his career, prompting Tsitsipas to helplessly scream, ""SO MUCH POWER!"" Qatar and Dubai would end with close loses to fellow tough opponents, and a very windy day in Miami plus some inspired tennis from Hurkacz ended Rublev's early hard court season with a Miami semifinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz, the eventual Miami champion. 

In Monte Carlo, Rublev played the best tennis I've ever seen him play. First, Rublev beat RBA in one of the most intense clashes of the year, and then, Rublev eliminated Rafael Nadal - the king of clay, at Monte Carlo - in a grueling three set classic. Rublev and Ruud played two close sets, but ultimately, Rublev got the better of the Norwegian. Rublev announced after his win over Ruud that he was taking a wild-card into Barcelona, which was to begin right after Monte Carlo. Gassed from three tense battles, Rublev flopped against Tsitsipas, who had cruised to the final.

Now, we begin, the slump. Tired, Rublev would get whooped by Sinner. Then, Isner would frustrate and wear down a still sluggish Rublev. In Rome, Sonego would play exhilarating tennis to oust the Russian, a terrible first round match to Struff, and a mediocre grass season would send Rublev into the hard court season with modest expectations.

Rublev entered Toronto, looked decent against Fognini, and then, just crumbled against Isner. In Cincinnati, Rublev played pretty poor tennis, but still managed to make the final. Rublev beat Medvedev in the Cincinnati semifinals, but really, Medvedev beat himself - going ballistic after an occurence with a certain camera. Zverev promptly obliterated Rublev, outhitting, outstrategizing, and outgrinding Rublev. Tiafoe would then play a scintillating match, and Rublev, playing sub-optimally, would ultimately lose to Tiafoe in five sets during the third round of the US Open. 

Then, there was tonight's match against Diego Schwartzman. Rublev won, but God damn, it really felt like a hollow victory. Rublev made so many errors, played so predictably, and jesus, at the net, he disappointed, every single time. 

I want to talk about the Rublev game plan, the upsides, the down sides, and what I like to call, the Rublev cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Upside: The Forehand**

Perhaps Rublev's biggest upside is his forehand - the power and spin Rublev can get on a good day with that forehand rivals the likes of Nadal and Thiem. Against most lower ranked players, Rublev can whap the forehand a couple times, and essentially end the rally right there. Unfortunately, Rublev doesn't always position the forehand very well, but more on that later. Rublev's forehand almost never breaks down, it's reliable, controlled, it's tempered, it's melded, it's a complete stroke.

**Downside: The Return**

Rublev's return consistently disappoints me. It's no secret that big servers challenge Rublev immensely, in fact, when asked about having to play Paire, who had eliminated John Isner - arguably the greatest server of all time, although Karlovic is unbelievable, too - Rublev said, ""at least it's not Isner."" Rublev's return is just meager. Compared to Medvedev, or even Tsitsipas, Rublev's return isn't there. Rublev's return is weak, and a lot of his returns go straight into the net.

**Upside: First Serve**

Rublev's first serve is pretty impressive. When Rublev is in the zone, he can blast aces like Roddick, Federer, or Isner; I have seen Rublev play immaculate service games. On big points, Rublev loves going huge with the first serve, and when those gargantuan serves smash into the court, most returners have little to no chance of respectably getting the ball in play. 

**Downside: Second Serve**

While, Rublev's first serve is monstrous, Rublev's second serve is almost timid. (And yet Rublev still manages to double fault often.) Rublev's second serve doesn't have a lot of raw power, nor does it have tricky positioning - Rublev plays second serves so nervously, and ironically, those nerves just make Rublev double fault more, as he is tight, and not completely focused on the ball. Rublev's second serve is so exploitable, and players like Medvedev can basically pummel Rublev's second serve with blistering returns, often times faster than the serve. 

**Upside and Downside: Spirit**

Rublev has huge fighting spirit, which, for all players of that ""big heart, big game"" breed (Tiafoe, Rublev, PCB - who when on, is shockingly aggressive - Berrettini, Shapovalov.) is both a liability and a strength. Rublev can generate astonishing gets and huge winners under pressure; but he can also succumb to double faults, nerves, and cycles of errors and anger.

**Downside: Touch, Volley, Slice, Finesse, Positioning**

Rublev's biggest weakness comes here: he has such bad vollies, a terrible slice, and limited shotmaking. Rublev is so predictable: he grinds you, but he has nothing else. Rublev has so few tools in his toolbox: it's laughable. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should Andrey do? 

1) Develop a Plan B. One issue for Rublev is that when he starts to lose, he has no solution other than upping his power, which is almost useless. First of all, hitting with even more power than Rublev already does requires so much effort, and often necessitates Rublev leaning in on the ball, leading to overhits, and pushing the racquet foreword instead of up. Rublev also tends to lose focus a lot in his ""mindless bashing"" phases when losing, and then gets extremely frustrated. A realistic Plan B for Rublev would involve taking fewer risks, and throwing in more variety.

2) Variety. Speaking of variety, Rublev really needs this: his game is so predictable, it's just pathetic. Rublev doesn't throw in dropshots, slices, changes in pace (besides going from normal to BWEH!) or really anything else. Rublev is like the guy at the club who beats everyone the first time, but then gets figured out. Rublev needs to keep opponents guessing. A good example of adding variety would be Medvedev - Medvedev is a huge grinder, but even he'll add dropshots, changes of pace, and will at least attempt to conquer some cheap points at the net. Fognini, on the other hand, brilliantly deploys shotmaking to keep opponents confused, and out of their comfort zones.

3) Curb the losing cycle. Rublev has this vicious cycle, which I touched on earlier: start to lose, hit harder, make more errors, get frustrated, subsequently lose focus, make more errors, lose match. (Unless your opponent in Schwartzman, who just kinda disappeared.) When Rublev starts to lose, he needs to adapt, he needs to tinker, he needs to use his imagination, he needs to keep his opponent on the move, uncomfortable, and guessing, but more importantly, he needs to keep morale up. Some sports psychology could really help Rublev. (I've actually watched the Rublev documentary, and Rublev opens up on his struggles with depression, and that guy has struggled a lot, especially with confidence / self-belief.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Rublev needs to define himself. What does he want to be? He can be another boring, mid-tier baseliner, who can go deep in slams and masters, but walk away with minimal trophies. As far as the power game goes, Rublev gets outclassed by Thiem, Zverev, and Medvedev, who all practice **controlled aggression.** (Aggression with a plan; it seems like Rublev can only hit the ball smart, or hit the ball hard, not both simultaneously.) Rublev's serve gets outclassed by Berrettini, Zverev, Medvedev, and perhaps even Tsitsipas. Rublev's forehand is outclassed by Medvedev, Zverev, and Berrettini. Rublev's touch is obliterated by everyone, and his second serve rivals Zverev in grand slam finals. However, Rublev can get the most raw power of the next gen.

Rublev needs to harness his power, and work on adding three strategies:

 **Controlled aggression: set up the point, procedurally build pace, crush opponents' rhythm.**

**Free points: serve and volley, well position winners, aces, otherwise unreturnable serves, drop shot winners, lob winners.**

 **Creative grinding: grind with an escape plan; Medvedev and Zverev can out-grind Rublev, so Rublev needs to find a way out of the grind style he's embraced.**

&amp;#x200B;

Rublev is a player with huge up-side, his easy power is astonishingly, and always amazes me, however, he needs to work on adapting. Rublev could be a world number one, seasoned grand slam champion, but to do so, I think he'll actually have to go down first, he needs to start experimenting: start rushing the net, start messing around with angles, start building points in creative ways, work on the lob, try out chip and charge + serve and volley, work on changing pace. And of course, hit some points with crazy raw power: Rublev's BWEHING is fine, IF the Bwehing is infrequent. Rublev might have to lose a fair bit in order to improve these weaker elements of his game (after all, his volleys, for example, will probably let him down until he's improved them by using them a lot more.)

Rublev has all the tools necessary to succeed, he just needs both the confidence to experiment, accepting that he might lose before he starts to win, and he also needs the mental headspace necessary to keep control of the match. (I think a lot of the BWEEEHING is a result of anger, and might not even really be a conscious decision on Rublev's part.) 

If Rublev can master controlled aggression, and versatility, then he will be the best in the world. I know these points seem obvious, but I am so sick of seeing Rublev collapse into power.

I leave you with this, the steps Rublev should take:

**1) Spend the rest of the season working on hitting with angles; constructing better shots shouldn't be too hard, as Rublev has already demonstrated that he can hit with good angles.** 

**2) Hire a sports psychologist. I don't want to see Rublev enter self-destruct, mindless power mode, and I also hate seeing the passive tennis he plays against Medvedev and Zverev, and against virtually anyone in big matches.**

**3) Spend the off weeks developing volleys, while still spending some time keeping the BWEH strokes polished**

**4) Use the 2022 season as a testing ground: enter lots of 250s, experiment, build confidence, build adaptation**

**5) If all goes well in 2022, use the 2022-2023 off period to focus on slice and lob. Use the 2023 season to focus on bringing everything together. Hopefully Rublev's confidence and Tennis IQ will be higher by then.**

***The big takeaway: Rublev needs to experiment. He needs to develop three to five methods of winning points, and stronger improv skills. I think Vincente is a good coach, but he needs more. Fix the volleys, then the second serve, then the drop shot, then brush up on the slice, and hopefully by mid-to-late 2023, Rublev will be ready to climb to the top of the rankings!***",1632538929

I'm seeing that this registry doesn't seem to exist anymore. Looking around online, I found a bunch of businesses like PlayYourCourt that links players to coaches, but the prices are quite high, and I'm guessing it's because these sorts of businesses take a pretty big cut from the coaches. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on finding a coach independently? If possible, I'd like to avoid going through a service like PlayYourCourt or a tennis club that tacks on an extra charge.",1632514726

Would be tough for the europeans to win this, but I reckon they'd put up a fight with options to choose from Safin, Kafelnikov, Ferrero, Moya, Magnus Norman, Enqvist, Pioline, young Roger, Ivanisevic, Henman, Corretja, Haas and probably some others I'm forgetting.

Bit of background for y'all. I'm a software engineer, and an avid athlete, though its my mom who is the real tennis nerd. I've been posting in other sports subreddits looking at how they practice, but the inspiration for ideas I've been playing around really come from listening to my mom coming back from her practice sessions, where ""serves weren't working today"" or ""my backand volleys were off, I don't know why.""

This guy had various sports stuff posted but lots of short 30 min 90's tennis documentaries. Sort of like tennis roundups of the masters and even 500's like dubai or doha. These pieces were incredibly interesting as seeing now legends such as Edberg and Becker and Agassi fighting for ATP finals spots and be given media pieces like they were normal players. 

Title examples 

ATP (event) (year) 

ATP Memphis 1996

Trust me, tennis fans, you will not regret it. I have never been as intrigued as I was when watching those videos. I moved to the States and it's not available here. If anyone in the Middle East here has some spare time and an itch for tennis nostalgia, look it up and watch the videos and record them so that we can all archive them(On here) before it's lost due to time.

[https://www.tennis.com/news/articles/continental-divide#.U2K6tPldVoA](https://www.tennis.com/news/articles/continental-divide#.U2K6tPldVoA)

Here's one sentence from the 2nd article:

""As exciting as Nadal versus Federer is, the interest is nowhere near if an American player made the final.""

And here I am, thinking that *nothing* gets more exciting than a final between the big 3! I come from a country that has *never* won a tennis GS, and I don't think I would care if my countryman was in the fight. I wouldn't ever prefer that to watching a showdown between any of the ""big 3"".

Personally, I wasn't 100% sure of even which countries Djokovic, Federer, or Nadal came from. It just doesn't register. Even during the Olympics, I don't care about which country wins the tennis medal. It's the person, not the country.

What about you American guys? Is it true that you need an American in the sport for heightened interest?",1632417341

I thought Nadal's 2010 or 2008 was the best. But his best was 2013 in which he won 10/13 Finals. Novak's 2015 and Roger's 2006 was absolute madness. Probably tennis fans are already to prepared to see other's lose when they play against these three players in their prime.

But still we can't compare whose prime is best because different conditions, different players , their forms. However the tennis they produce is stunning and is an inspiring to future players, their never die attitude.

Feels like tennis has already replaced Osaka with Emma Raducanu. The new darling of the game. She has an exciting brand of tennis, charisma and is fun with the media. The fans love her too. She's also able to speak fully without saying ""um"" every two sentences.

Once I got serious, I bought a used Babolat PureDrive that‚Äôs been my normal driver since January of this year. I‚Äôm a solid 3.5 player (and that‚Äôs accurate‚ÄîI can‚Äôt believe how many people at my level don‚Äôt know how to self-rate and think they‚Äôre a 4.0 or something üòÇ)

It was my birthday recently and I got some money specifically for a new racquet, so I started to do some research. At first I was really interesting in trying out the Yonex and I also looked into Head. After a ton of research, though, I decided I wanted to try a heavier racquet. 

I demoed the Wilson Pro Staff RF97 for a week. YES, I‚Äôm a huge Federer fan. And YES, that definitely biased my selection. But I was truly interested in seeing how a heavier frame felt. 

I played a bunch with it, really enjoyed it, sent it back, and played some more with my PureDrive. While there are some shots I feel I can do better with the PureDrive (namely drop shot) it just felt too light. I missed the extra weight of the RF97, especially when it came to my backhand but also just generally. 

I was just about to order the RF97 but I happened to find another article talking about how anyone who gets it is DELUSIONAL because only pros can handle the extra weight. And I get it. It did take more to get it into place. But it feels like a racquet I can grow into, since it really rewarded preparation and proper form. 

The comment section to that article was fierce. There were fans, but a lot of talk about how you‚Äôre just gonna get injured playing with it.

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù and 250. I simply feel like the weight increase suits me better. I‚Äôm not playing 5 hours a day. Does anyone else here use a heavier racquet? What are your thoughts?",1632366357

Points left to defend from September 21st 2020 until the end of the season: 

Tour Finals (Medvedev won - 1500 points, Djokovic  - 400 points)

Medvedev is also defending R16 St. Petersburg (20) and QF Vienna (90) and Paris W (1000) 

Djokovic also reached the QF of Vienna (90).

So, just based on this years results + the points from the end of 2020 (as the ranking would usually work prior to the freeze/ change) the totals would be:

Medvedev: 6380 + 1500 + 1000 + 90 + 20 = 9090

Djokovic: 8370 + 400 + 90 = 8869

Between 2011-2014, Nadal faced 3 top 10 players in all of his RG runs, except in 2012 where he instead faced #12 Alamagro. His seeding would have allowed him to face a theoretical maximum of 12 top 10 players, he faced 11 and beat them all. Furthermore, he faced 3 TOP 5 players in a row in 2011. 

For context, in the 8 slams that Djokovic has won since 2018, he has faced 3 top 10 players only once, in RG 21. 

I feel this run gets somewhat underappreciated under his overall Clay GOATness, so wanted to bring more context.",1632322055

38,tennis,How do we think Leylah Fernandez will do over the next few years on the WTA tour?,"Now that we've had a million threads about Emma Raducanu and her seemingly limitless potential, we'll focus on Leylah Fernandez for now.

How do we think the rest of her year, and the next couple of years will pan out for her on the main tour?

I think she's very talented, but I'm still not sure exactly what her level is, given pre-USO, her results weren't that impressive at slam level or even on the main tour, aside from the one WTA title and 3R appearance at RG in 2020. 

Is this the breakthrough tournament that propels her forward and gives her the self-belief required to beat top-opponents regularly or was she peaking for 2 weeks? As with most things, time will reveal all. 

I genuinely believe had she not faced Raducanu in the final, she would have won regardless of her opponent.

She has an awesome forehand, decent backhand, good variety around the court, moves well, and an under-rated return of serve. 

As with a lot of women on the tour, the serve will be her biggest achilles' heel going forward when trying to string a series of decent results together to build confidence and momentum. Fortunately she's also a lefty, which will always make life uncomfortable for her opponents. She's also young enough that provided she gets good coaching, she'll continue to improve over the next few years.

I'd say she's definitely top 20. Consistently top 10? Have to wait and see. 

I think her serve will ultimately stop her making consistent runs at GSs aside from perhaps Roland Garros where there isn't as much currency on that particular shot.",1632320816

45,tennis,Grand Slam Champions without the Big 3 - The Maths,"Inspired by the [Murray without the Big 3 - The Maths](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/psg7iw/murray_without_the_big_3_the_maths/) post which attempted to calculate how many hypothetical Grand Slams Murray would have won had the Big 3 not been in picture.

**TL;DR**

Using Ultimate Tennis Statistics Hypothetical Matchup winners of GS titles were predicted, and the table of winners is given from 2003 onwards. 

**Introduction**

First of all it is important to point out that this result is achieved by applying the rules described below, **it does not take as an input any personal opinions/predictions.** That said, I have no way of knowing that this methodology is going to produce the most accurate results (the same way no one else can claim that about any other methodology, as we can never know for sure). My wish with this post is to attempt to apply some math on a real world problem, not to push any agendas. 

**Methodology**

Similarly to the original post, [Ultimate Tennis Statistics](https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/) Hypothetical Matchup function is used to predict the result of a match. As for which tournaments are considered, the following applies:

\-Any tournament before Wimbledon 2003 is considered unchanged. I don't think many people would object to this assumption.

\-Any tournament from Wimbledon 2003 onwards that has been won by someone other than a Big 3 member is considered unchanged. This point could be contested, but I was of the belief that if someone else won a GS in the Big 3 era, they deserve to keep it in this hypothetical scenario. 

This leaves us with 60 tournaments to consider. Next, all of the tournaments that were given to Murray by the original post were also given to him here. In actuality, if the methodology were applied to these tournaments as well Murray would end up as the victor either way. 

Now for the rest, we make three assumptions: 

1. If a Big 3 member didn't make it to the Quarterfinals of a tournament, nothing changes
2. If a Big 3 member was present in a QF, it is assumed that his opponent won the match
3. Matches that happened in our timeline not involving the Big 3 don't change their results

The only two Grand Slams where 2 of the Big 3 have met in the quarterfinals are 2006 and 2015 French Open (both of them being contested between Djokovic and Nadal). I already gave the FO15 to Stan Wawrinka as the real-life winner, so we have to consider only the FO06. We will assume that Ivan Ljubicic made it to the final as the semi-finalist that went against Nadal. 

Now let's look at the predictions using the 2008 Wimbledon Championships as the example.

First quarterfinal was between Federer and Mario Ancic. We assume that Ancic won this match, as it is a quarterfinal. Second quarterfinal is between Marat Safin and Feliciano Lopez. As Safin won this match in our timeline, we assume this stays the same. Similarly, the winner of the third quarterfinal is Rainer Schuettler. The fourth QF was contested between Nadal and Murray, so we assume Murray won that match. We are left with the following semis:

Ancic - Safin

Schuttler - Murray

Now that we have 2 matches that didn't happen in our timeline, we use the Hypothetical Matchup function. The results are following:

**Ancic** **61% - 39% Safin**

**Schuettler 21% - 79% Murray**

Now, we assume that the more likely winner **always** wins a matchup. We end up with Ancic - Murray final. The result is 

**Ancic 49.6% - 50.4% Murray.** 

The winner of WI08 is Andy Murray. I have chosen this tournament as an example because of how different the result is to the original post, which only gives Murray a 20% shot at winning the tournament. First notable difference is the absence of players that didn't make it to QF, Hewitt and Youzhny. Next, Murray doesn't require a &gt;50% chance of winning a tournament in order to win it, rather he just needs to get through his matchups one by one. This final match-up in particular is very close, so the real result would probably be much more random. That said, this methodology does give us the most likely winner of the tournament. 

While statistically, according to the original post, Murray would have won further 10 tournaments had the Big 3 been out of the picture, he is the **most likely winner** of further 15 grand slams, on top of his 3. This would make him the winner of 18 total GS titles, the most of any male player in Singles category. He would also win a Calendar Grand Slam in 2011, and a Three-Quarter Calendar Grand Slam in 2012 and 2016. 

**Results**

[Grand Slam alternate Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/zipvf2v432p71.png?width=1470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90ce2994375d63bd030db180a8b7d608fc59010f)

I believe there are some people that will find these results interesting, as have I, and some that will try to dispute them. I am in no way trying to say that these would certainly be the results. All discussion is welcomed. 

**Conclusion**

The results were achieved with me entering all the match-ups by hand, so it is entirely possible that I have made a mistake here and there, sadly I am not a good enough coder to write a script to do this for me. If I was, it would have been possible to simulate all the tournaments in the ATP Tour, as well as to change the seeds in tournaments in accordance to new winners. An interesting result could be achieved by selecting a winner randomly with the probability given by the Hypothetical Matchup function, maybe even simulating the entire ATP Tour, looking at weeks at number 1, most Masters titles...

My conclusion is that this is a very interesting mathematical concept, but it is nothing more than that. It is an intriguing exercise (at least it is intriguing to me), but it does not show us anything of real-world application. There is no way to know how the psyche or retirement plans or injuries would change had the Big 3 been out of picture, nor do I believe it is a productive discussion. Ultimately, they were here and have (so far) won 60 Grand Slam titles. I don't think there is any tennis fan that wishes they never played the game.",1632317340

In his prime, he was as good on clay as Nadal was on grass, it just so happened he was playing during the time of Nadal. If not for Nadal, Federer would prolly 3 or more French Open titles and he was 2nd only to Nadal as a clay court player from 2005-2011. HOWEVER, from 2000-2004, in which Nadal had not arrived on scene, why did Federer not win any Roland Garros titles, let alone make it to a final. I mean he was losing in the first rounds and 2nd rounds, which is quite surprising considering how good he was in 2005 onwards on clay.

I think after the Big 3, Sampras, Borg and Laver he's the greatest player to ever play. I often see people rating Agassi, McEnroe or even Connors higher but I think it's completely false. He played in arguably the toughest tennis era, had incredible longevity at the No. 1 spot, won a million titles, had a winning record against almost everyone and owned Mac in their head to head mostly.

I think not winning Wimbledon definitely hurt his legacy and also his chances to win other slams. He had a poor conversion rate especially at the USO but had he won 2 more, then I think he could have even overtaken Borg.

66,tennis,USTA League Woes - Making me lose my passion for tennis,"Hi,

Wanted to just kind of vent a little and get people's thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing tennis since I was around 8/9 and am 26 now. I didn't play in college but played in high school and after college picked it back up again and have been playing since.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently signed up for USTA (thinking why not, it will give me some good match practice) but it's combo doubles season. I thought what the hell why not (I am a 4.0 singles player and normally don't play much doubles but hey it's fun and I want more match practice anyways).

&amp;#x200B;

So I signed up for one of the teams around my area that's an 8.5 Combo doubles team and the captain just got bumped up to 4.0 on the computer (again, I am new to USTA so I wasn't too familiar with this computer stuff until I read more about it).

&amp;#x200B;

I attended 2 team practices where we played sets. I played my heart out in both practices and even though my partner made more mistakes than I did I didn't care and tried to just have fun and not worry about the score too much since I wanted to just keep working on my strokes and doubles play.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am actually the youngest on the team (seems like a lot of the older guys prefer doubles). The captain is a decent player although nothing special. 

&amp;#x200B;

In both practices I ended up losing the sets I played (although I did have some unforced errors a majority came from my partners). I didn't think too much of it since we were just practicing.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway so long story short my captain shoots me a text message saying that although I'm a solid 4.0 player he thinks my doubles game needs work because I lost the sets and wants me to rate myself as a 3.5 and play as a 3.5 for 2-3 years before getting bumped up.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very upset by this and told him he can either kick me off the team or play me less (I don't care, I'd rather just play the singles season next year).

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to vent because I absolutely love tennis and it's a huge passion of mine. But this whole league play thing seems like a pressure cooker where it's like if you have an off day or make a couple errors you get screwed over. It just ruins the fun of the game because I didn't know that the practices were to be taken that seriously (win/loss). The captain seemed so chill about it too. 

&amp;#x200B;

This team never even made it to sectionals in my region ever!

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced something similar? I might just find another team but this experience really has destroyed my love of the game.",1632288365

Can you think of any other sporting tourney with a similar system of scoring? 

It would be better if every match was worth one point, everyone played singles on Day 1 or 2, then each team could choose 3 players to compete on the third day.

**Some notes**

\- We can work this out by using the probability of winning each Slam in which he lost against a member of the big 3 (after removing them), and adding the numbers together.  We replace the big3 member with the most likely alternative based on the draw.

\- In order to calculate the probability of winning a match I am using the Hypothetical Matchup feature within [https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/](https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/)

\- This is purely looking at the maths using a simple model.  We are not interested here in whether Murray was able to raise his level without them around, or whether other players raised their game to match Murray.  These are valid points but do not belong here.

\- Where Murray beat a member of the big3 we give him this win regardless.  We are only looking at the losses.

The meme is unclear as to whether we are only removing one of the big 3, or all 3 so I'll calculate for both.

**Without Federer**

Instead of becoming a 20 slam champion, and having nightmares of the numbers 40 and 15, Roger instead becomes a tour guide and spends his days hiking around the alps.

**US Open 2008:** Murray faces Djokovic in the final and has a **35%** chance of winning.

**Aus Open 2010:** Murray faces Davydenko in the final and has a **57%** chance of winning.

**Wimbledon 2012:** Murray faces Djokovic in the final and has a **38%** chance of winning.

**Aus Open 2014:** Murray faces Tsonga in the QF (**74%**), Nadal in the SF (**28%**), and Wawrinka in the final (**67%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **14%**.

**Wimbledon 2015:** Murray faces Simon in the SF (**85%**), and Djokovic in the final (**41%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **35%.**

Adding these together gives a total of **1.78** more slams for Murray if Federer never became a pro.  Most likely he wins AO2010 and probably (if we round up) Wimbledon 2012.

**Without Nadal**

Instead of becoming a 13 time French Open champion, and a star of 25625656 Capybara memes, Nadal becomes a professional footballer.

**Aus Open 2007:** Murray faces Wawrinka in the 4R (**69%**), Gonzalez in the QF (**40%**), Haas in the SF (**46%)**, and Federer in the final (**9%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **1%**

**Wimbledon 2008:** Murray faces Youzhny in the QF (**56%**), Schuettler in the SF (**79%**) and Federer in the final (**12%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **5%**

**Wimbledon 2010:** Murray faces Soderling in the SF (**66%**) and Berdych in the final (**62%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **41%**

**French Open 2011:** Murray faces Soderling in the SF (**49%**) and Federer in the final (**31%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **15%**

**Wimbledon 2011:** Murray faces Fish in the SF **(69%)** and Djokovic in the final **(50%).**  Probability of winning the slam is **35%**

**US Open 2011:** Murray faces Roddick in the SF (**78%**) and Djokovic in the final (**26%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **20%**

**French Open 2014:** Murray faces Ferrer in the SF (**39%**) and Djokovic in the final (**21%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **8%**

Adding these together gives a total of **1.26** more slams for Murray if Nadal never became a pro.  Most likely he wins Wimbledon 2010, and possibly (but unlikely if we round down) Wimbledon 2011.

**Without Djokovic**

Instead of becoming a 20 time slam champion, and the most popular player on the tour, Djokovic sells Home Remedies from his flat in Belgrade.

**Aus Open 2011:** Murray faces Federer in the final and has a **29%** chance of winning.

**Aus Open 2012:** Murray faces Ferrer in the SF (**69%**) and Nadal in the final (**49%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **33%**

**Aus Open 2013:** Murray faces Ferrer in the final and has a **61%** chance of winning.

**US Open 2014:** Murray faces Kohlschreiber in the QF (**81%**), Nishikori in the SF (**65%**) and Cilic in the final (**63%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **41%**

**Aus Open 2015:** Murray faces Wawrinka in the final and has a **59%** chance of winning.

**French Open 2015:** Murray faces Nadal in the SF (**45%**) and Wawrinka in the final (**59%**).  Probability of winning the slam is **26%**

**Aus Open 2016:**  Federer in the final and has a **36%** chance of winning.

**French Open 2016:** Murray faces Berdych in the final and has a 77% chance of winning.

Adding these together gives a total of **3.63** more slams for Murray if Djokovic never became a pro.  Most likely he wins Aus Open 2013, Aus Open 2015, French Open 2016 and probably US Open 2014.

**Without any of the big 3**

I'll shorten these to avoid too much text.

AO07: **4%** (Wawrinka -&gt; Gonzalez -&gt; Haas -&gt; Roddick)

WI08: **20%** (Youzhny -&gt; Schuettler -&gt; Hewitt)

US08: **53%** (Roddick)

AO10: **57%** (Davydenko)

WI10: **41%** (Soderling -&gt; Berdych)

AO11: **77%** (Berdych)

FO11: **32%** (Soderling -&gt; Monfils)

WI11: **50%** (Fish -&gt; Tsonga)

US11: **56%** (Roddick -&gt; Tsonga)

AO12: **49%** (Ferrer -&gt; Berdych)

WI12: **83%** (Youzhny)

AO13: **61%** (Ferrer)

AO14: **41%** (Tsonga -&gt; Nishikori -&gt; Wawrinka)

FO14: **22%** (Ferrer -&gt; Tsonga)

US14: **41%** (Kohlschreiber -&gt; Nishikori -&gt; Cilic)

AO15: **59%** (Wawrinka)

FO15: **46%** (Gasquet -&gt; Wawrinka)

WI15: **70%** (Simon -&gt; Cilic)

AO16: **72%** (Nishikori)

FO16: **77%** (Berdych)

Adding these together gives Murray an extra **10.13** slams.  (Lets round to 10) He falls just short of Sampras after a chase for several years.

His final slam honours list.

**US08, AO10, AO11**, **US11**, **WI12**, US12, **AO13**, WI13, **AO15**, **WI15**, **AO16**, **FO16**, WI16

40,tennis,"A majority of Grand Slam match Novak Djokovic was expected to win and did not, he has been either injured or coming off playing a 5 setter since 2015 (almost). An analysis of Novaks losses in grand slams for most of his prime. Which ones surprised you guys?","\*NOTE: Excluding the time period after Nole Slam where Nole sustained his elbow injury and was not in form, from Wimbledon 2016 - French Open 2018\* 

We all know Novak as a robot, and to me there has rarely not been a time in a slam I did not think he was the favorite / should have won the match going in (I will address exceptions). Of all these matches most of them each can be grouped into an injury he had or coming off a tough 5 setter in the previous round. Here are all the matches:  


2019 US Open vs Wawrinka: Retired due to injury

2015 French Open vs Wawrinka: Tough 5 setter vs Murray in SF (though I think Novak was probably fine here, Wawrinka just played incredibly)

2020 US Open: Defaulted

2020 French Open: 5 setter with Tsitsipas in the semis

2021 US Open: 5 setter with Zverev in the semi finals, didn't have his legs

&amp;#x200B;

*This can even be stretched out to 2011 with a few more exceptions*

2013 Wimbledon Final vs Murray: Coming off a brutal 5 set semi vs Del Potro (one of the great matches of the big 4 era imo) - didn't have his legs

2013 US Open Final: Coming off a grind out 5 setter with Wawrinka in the semi final (this is the one match above all others of novaks I cannot believe he lost post 2010)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now for the exceptions:**

**(Note:** I do not think he should have been expected to win the 2012 wimbledon semifinal vs Federer, nor any french open match vs Nadal other than 2015)

2011 French Open Semi Finals vs Federer: Yes, Federer played great (some say it was his best clay court match ever, but I am skeptical his best clay match ever would still lead to a very close 4 setter with Djoker) but Djoker had a lot of pressure having not lost up to that point in 2011, and I think his opponent withdrawing from his QF hurt him going into this match.

2012 USOpen Final vs Murray: Insane wind, weird match for sure seemed like Novak lost the form he had in 2011 after the 2012 Australian Open

2014 AOQF vs Wawrinka: Wawrinka just played lights out

2014 USOSF vs Nishikori - probably the weirdest defeat of his prime, 2013 + 2014 were tough for him and just weird years, this being the weirdest match of his to lose

2019 French Open vs Thiem: Novak had an insane second half of 2018 til the AO2019. Similar to 2012, he seemed to dip in form + mentality after the AO 2019 and the rest of 2019 was meh for him. While he did lose this match I was not surprised, he did not seem in usual form this year. Of all the years Federer played him in the Wimbledon final, 2019 was the best chance because Djoker was just off that year (and that match other than the 3 tiebreaks)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Yes, there are the exceptions. I will always say that 2012-14 was just a weird time for Djokovic. His 2011 style and 2015 style were actually quite different  [as I alluded to here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/pqfnmi/why_did_djokovic_start_playing_less_aggressively/hdao3w8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) , and that period seemed to be when he stopped being able to just hit a winner out of anywhere on the court on command, but still had his world #1 confidence. When Djokovic was really in his best form (2011-AO12, 2015 - 2016FO, second half 2018 - 2019 AO, 2020-2021) he is virtually unbeatable except for Nadal at the FO in form, who is actually unbeatable. If you take clay out the picture, mans has truly just been a rock for over a decade now its insane. With no other player can I truly reason out why he lost every time, Federer and Nadal both have matches they really shoulda won but just didnt that day and I don't even have reasons like I do for djokovic. I might be stretching this out a little bit, but what do you guys think of Djokers losses since 2015 (or 2011).",1632199900

But then I looked at Australian Open finals and there is no Djokovic v Federer matchup. This is despite the fact that Novak has 9 Australian Open titles and Roger has 6. 

Novak is 9-0 in Australian Open finals and has beaten Tsonga (2008), Murray (2011), Nadal (2012), Murray (2013), Murray (2015), Murray (2016), Nadal (2019), Thiem (2020), and Medvedev (2021). 

Roger is 6-1 in Australian Open finals and has beaten Safin (2004), Baghdatis (2006), Gonzalez (2007), lost to Nadal (2009), then beat Murray (2010), Nadal (2017), Cilic (2018). 

They have faced each other 5 times at the Australian Open. The first meeting was in round of 16 in 2007 (Roger won). Novak has won the other 4 meetings, all in the semifinals (2008, 2011, 2016, and 2020).",1632190756

56,tennis,Emma Raducanu : Andy Murray won't 'wade in' with advice and opinion,"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/58633034](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/58633034)

A sensible take from Andy Murray in my opinion. 

As Emma herself stated, she's on her own trajectory, tennis is an individual sport, so you have to be left to make your own choices in your career that you feels benefits you.  Sometimes having too many opinions from former players circulating around inside your head with suggestions on what aspects of your game you need to work can be irritating after a while.

From what I've seen they've practiced together before, watched each other play in practice, and taken part in a few competitive doubles matches together as part of the ""Battle of the Brits"" competition during the pandemic.  She mentioned that alongside the likes of Henman and Wade, that he was an inspiration to her and they occasionally talk.

I'm sure they have a good relationship, and she probably knows that if she needs the advice (especially around Wimbledon time) he'll be on the other end of the phone if need be.",1632177325

I thought it was going to be a cake walk as I used to play at a 5.0 level (I planned on ""going easy"", I didn't join for easy wins). As it turns out, many other people have joined this 3.0 league as higher level players just to get some exercise in, I'm definitely the youngest player at 25, with the median age being 50.  

I was expecting this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rOHWoCQsNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rOHWoCQsNU), and walked into some of the best players I've gone up against. 

I got destroyed on the first set, but won the next two due re-balancing to match my skill level. I have a great serve, with maybe 60% service winners. 

My biggest weakness is reaction time when receiving serves, I can make contact with the ball, but not fast enough to return it accurately. It's a little embarrassing. Not sure how I can work on this without a partner.

1) Canada

65,tennis,What would each individual big 3 member's career look like if you removed the other 2 from existence?,"Firstly, I would like to say that I did this purely for fun and it is not supposed to be used for another toxic debate about who or what is better.

Secondly, I will only be looking at grand slam tournaments and weeks at number 1. This is because these are the stats most often used in these Big 3 discussions and changing all of the ATP Masters results would have taken me too long (maybe for another time).

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, the rules I used were as such. I only eliminate the best placing result of the removed players. If the final of a Grand Slam tournament was played between both removed players the higher-ranked player in the Semi-Finals becomes the new champion. 

For example, if Nadal lost the final of RG to Djokovic in the adjusted reality he becomes the victor. However if the final is Federer vs Djokovic and the semi-finalists are Number 3 Nadal and Number 4 Murray, Nadal becomes the new victor.

This method lead to some situations where you would argue the victor should be different but for simplicities sake, I decided to do it in this manner.

67,tennis,Really basic beginners questions!,"I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate post.

I have some really basic questions as a beginner who's just started to place tennis with some friends. I would really appreciate it if someone could answer them.

1) Serving team - is there usually a toss-up to determine which team serves first? 

2) Serving side in a doubles games - I know the rotation pattern generally, but how do you determine which side you serve from on you team? Do you just stay on the side of the previous game? 

3) Skimming the net and going over - I know this is a fault in a serve, but is it allowed during a rally?

4) racket over the net - I'm guessing it obviously isn't allowed if the swing is so close to the net that it ends on the other side.

5) the same goes with touching the net. Is this allowed?

6) Hitting a ball that is out - what is the rule here? Is the ball still in play if its not called before the hit? What if you call it after? What if your partner calls it or even the other team and the ball is still hit? Is it still in play?

I'm guessing there are many other rules, but this will do so far.

Many thanks to whoever replies!

35,tennis,Will Djokovic‚Äôs Loss be good or bad for him long term?,"I can see it going both ways. 

Good: The pressure is off. Last time Djokovic achieved something so historic, after his 2016 Roland Garros win, he fell off a cliff mentally and physically. The injury was unfortunate but for a while after that he still played like someone who just couldn‚Äôt get 100% committed. And it would be understandable if, after the mental fortitude needed to win all four in a row, a loss of focus was inevitable. There was nowhere to go but down, and he went down harder than anyone anticipated. 

But now he has, in a sense, freed himself from that pressure. Medvedev‚Äôs breakthrough takes some expectation off of Novak for Australia - being the clear cut favourite is a lot of pressure, the underdog has the expectation of defeat as a cushion, if they take it that away. He‚Äôs not an underdog, but there isn‚Äôt the expectation that it‚Äôs his to lose. 

Bad: it was an omen of what‚Äôs to come. Novak looked mentally and physically drained, unable to compete in rallies and maintain scoreboard pressure against a redlining and baseline controlling opponent, who escaped an early 0-40 hope in set two - something that never happens to Novak, especially in a final. One of either of those to barriers to success would be one thing to overcome, but for top level athletes a physical hurdle can feed mental difficulties. Losing trust in your body is super damaging. Nearly five and a half years have passed since he held all four, that‚Äôs how long primes of careers used to last. How long can this Novak domination last? How long can his body endure? It‚Äôs entirely possible we could look back on this as a career turning point for both. Interested in your thoughts, his Australian Open level will be fascinating to see.",1632106705

57,tennis,Need to choose 3 rackets to demo from Tennis Warehouse,"Hey all, I know there's a million racket recommendation threads already, but searching on tennis warehouse/amazon is a little overwhelming. There's so many different variables/choices! 

Consequently, I'm gonna do the Tennis Warehouse demo program where you get to try out three rackets for a week before shipping them back.

So I'm looking to choose three rackets that represent a pretty good spread of features so I can get a better sense of my preferences. 

A little about myself and my game: 

* Intermediate skill level. I play in a casual ladder and destroy the casual players, but get punished by good players who don't let me choose my shots and can exploit weaknesses.

* 37 years old, 6'3, 210 lbs, but despite my size, I play a precision game, not power. I win on shot selection and consistency, not by slamming winners.

* I've never taken lessons, and am pretty sure some of my swing mechanics are wonky and need to be improved.

* I currently played with a cheapo $30 Wilson I bought off amazon before I was sure I wanted to commit, but now ready to invest in a real racket

* No super hard budget restrictions, but expecting to pay ~$200. 

With that in mind, what's a good spread of rackets to look at? Some options I've found recommended in other threads: 

* Wilson Blade
* Wilson Clash 100
* Babolat Pure Drive
* Yonex Ezone

Any recommendations greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance :)",1632080723

63,tennis,Is 18 (almost 19) too late to try and get into competitive tennis?,"My deepest regret is not realise how good I was when I was younger. I never played any competitive matches, only coaching and friendly games. Seeing Emma Raducanu win the other day was a real eye opener for me (especially as we come from the same part of London AND I've played on a court beside her before). Is there time to train and play on a competitive level?

I first started when I was 8 years old but between now and then I've been very inconsistent with my playing. I've maintained a high intermediate level most of my life but I want to go further. Now, I'm not going to stop and I'm latching onto the first opportunity I can get to progress forwards in some direction. I've emailed a few coaches - some I know already - to see if there doing 1-1 coaching and I will without a doubt make drastic improvements between now and next year. I will be having a similar discussion with them also. I will be playing as much as possible each week + social tennis on a Sunday. 

I need some honesty here though people - is 18 (nearly 19) too late to begin the climb? Whatever the answer may be, I'm still determined to achieve as much as I possible can in the coming years and I'll never let any talent of mine go to waste every again.",1632073877

94,tennis,Confused about racquets‚Ä¶,"Getting back into tennis after a couple decades. The last time I really played regularly and took lessons was in high school when I played on the team. 

I was trying different racquets recently and really felt like I was hitting better with my friend‚Äôs Prince 1500 (anyone familiar with this one)? It‚Äôs oversized and says 120 in. Should I be playing with something that big? I was surprised by how much better I was hitting with this racquet. Which leads to my next question:

When I played in high school, my first racquet was an older sibling‚Äôs hand me down Wilson Sting. Prob from early 1990s and already several years old by the time I got it. I then ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to a Head ‚Äúmid plus‚Äù racquet (older sister who knew nothing about tennis bought it as a Christmas gift bc it was a $140 racquet on clearance for like $30 lol) I still have. It seems so heavy! It‚Äôs 12 oz strung. As a small, female high school player shouldn‚Äôt I have been using a light, over-sized racquet?? This was the era of the super light Wilson Hammers (mid-late 1990s). Was 12 oz considered heavy back then? I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm dwelling on this years later but I feel like a coach should have advised me on racquet selection as looking back this racquet doesn‚Äôt seem like the best choice. No one mentioned anything. Also no mention of adding/changing over-grips, restringing etc. Learning all this hardware stuff now way past my tennis heyday. I wonder if I would have been a better player with a lighter racquet. Thanks for listening.",1632027682

26,tennis,Favourite iconic points in men's tennis US Open,"I'll put some of them in no particular order, add yours in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

* Connors vs Haarhuis 1991 US Open, 6-4 5-4 with Haarhuis serving for a 2 set lead, 39 years old Connors making a miraculous run and breaking back and I swear I haven't seen the US Open crowd as loud and I believe there was no one sitting on the crowd.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e38U3Oa3s5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e38U3Oa3s5s)
* Sampras vs Agassi 1995 US Open, set point for Sampras, breaks to take the set in a classic rally against his most important rival in tennis .  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m\_AEejbhaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m_AEejbhaA)
* Agassi vs Baghdatis 2006 US Open, no specific point just watch the match it sums up so well what Agassi was, it was an iconic match.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bsaEEJ9GgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bsaEEJ9GgE)
* Federer vs Djokovic 2009 US Open, clean tweener to set up match point, not much to say it was amazing, the atmosphere, the crowd going crazy, going for a US Open title after winning RG and Wimbledon b2b and getting Sampras's GS record. I love in hindsight how Del Potro won the next match for his only Slam but at the time it felt weird watching Federer lose that match after having won the semis against Djokovic like that, it seemed unreal he could lose.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMJ0-1GGf5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMJ0-1GGf5k)
* Djokovic vs Federer 2011 US Open, the forehand return, that match had all the fairytale story for Federer in it, he was finally going to face Nadal in the final of the US Open, he had not won a Slam that year, he had lost with 2 MPs up the year before against Djokovic in the semis, 2 sets up, halts his opponent's comeback in the fifth set and serves for the match, we've seen that scene too many times, whole crowd cheering for Federer before a serve and him ending with an unreturned serve and the crowd going crazy, it was obvious what was going to happen. Suddenly, I don't know what the hell through Djokovic's head to come up with that forehand winner on the return and change the match, he just went on to close one of the best seasons in tennis history and mark the start of a decade dominated by him.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_OYcZSlKD48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OYcZSlKD48)
* Djokovic vs Nadal 2013 US Open, 54 shots rally for Djokovic to break, it seemed he was going to turn the match around (and he did for a while, break up in the third) but his tank wasn't that full that day, it's sad because I believe both at 100% (fitness wise) was going to be a 5 set match of some out of this world rallies with no clear winner for the match.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5eQmwvvtyU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5eQmwvvtyU)

There are much more (like in the 2011 US Open final has too many ridiculous points but I wouldn't consider them iconic because there were so many it just makes it hard for one to stand out) and I have to go out, so please add yours. I'll add my bonuses because Roddick is my favourite player:

* Roddick vs Corretja US Open 2002, iconic celebration, iconic look with the visor, crowd going crazy on match point.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN2ahQHXb4E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN2ahQHXb4E)
* Roddick vs Chela US Open 2002, like the commentary said, was down and with the match on favour for Chela and that point changed the dynamic completely.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zaM16oRKzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zaM16oRKzo)
* Roddick vs Ferrero US Open 2003, last men's tennis american winner finishes with 3 straight aces with his particular service motion, love you A-Rod.

37,tennis,I‚Äôm an NYC tour guide and I thought I‚Äôd share a short story about tennis,"I don‚Äôt know a lot about tennis I dunno if this is appropriate for the subreddit, but I thought maybe people here would like this story.

I work as a tour guide on top of a double decker buses that you see going around the city. I was giving a tour last week or so and there was this surly teen is pouting in the first row the whole time. She caught my attention because she looked incredibly distant, in her head, pissed and not interested in the tour. Her mom, meanwhile was super friendly and asking a lot of questions.

There‚Äôs a lot of tennis courts in Manhattan, especially this type that‚Äôs domed that are on top of some roof tops of buildings here.

We pass one and the mom asks about it

MOM: What is that?
ME: oh, it‚Äôs a tennis court
MOM: (turns to daughter) look honey, a tennis-
KID: SHUT THE FUCK UP MOM
MOM: (to me) don‚Äôt mind her she just lost the US Open.

When I got home I ended up looking up the girl and realized she lost the first seed of the women‚Äôs (girl‚Äôs?) division.

I just thought it was funny because in big sporting events these people will lose and vanish from your TV screen and I never thought to think that you‚Äôd be watching the worst thing to happen to someone that year.",1631984020

63,tennis,Do you think tennis streaming sites should allow you to download and keep matches so you can replay them when you want?,"As I like to re-watch certain matches that I have enjoyed over the years I have built up quite a collection that I store on a few hard drives. Now that many matches are going to streaming sites like Amazon Prime it's getting harder and harder to keep them, without having to go down the path of visiting some shady websites or capture devices to grab them. I wonder if the streaming sites should allow them to be purchased or part of your package so you can download and keep them on external devices. 

Though I've managed to keep quite a few of the WTA matches from this years US open for my collection it's not as easy as it used to be. In times gone by it was so easy to pop a VHS tape in (yes I'm that old) and hit record but not with DVR's like Sky or Virgin you can't back things up without having to put a bit of effort in.

I know you can sometimes grab match replays from YouTube and such but it's often very hit or miss if you can either get the match you want or if it's a good video quality post.

I know there could be a piracy issue, if sites starting allowing this type of service but if these sites remove content from there websites as they all do, shouldn't we be allowed to keep the things we want if we are paying for these packages?",1631947699

66,tennis,"Prediction: Federer, Nadal, Murray and Williams sisters all retire within 2 years, with most if not all of them retiring by the end of next year.","Federer is 40 and dealing with a 3rd knee surgery. There is zero hope of him winning another Grand Slam. He possibly plays another Wimbledon, but will likely retire at Basel next year.

Nadal's injuries finally seem to be catching up to him. He has never skipped Wimbledon and US Open back-to-back before. He is ranked 6 and according to another Redditor his ranking will drop to 8 by the end of the year. This may be a controversial statement but I don't think he's winning another French Open again, which seems strange to say as before this year I would have expected him to win another 2-3. I can also see him retiring next year. Perhaps he lasts a little longer since his dropoff isn't as steep as Federer's; however, he doesn't seem the type to prolong his career if he's not at the very top. I see him retiring 2022-2023 and becoming more of a family man.

Murray has been trying to get back into the top 100 with no success. There have been positive signs here and there, such as him getting to the 3rd round of Wimbledon and him taking Tsitsipas to 5 at the US Open. Unfortunately, there are just as many moments where he crashes out early at smaller tournaments, such as Rennes. If he somehow manages good runs in Slams (at least 3rd rounds) and gets back into the top 100, I can maybe see him retiring in 2023, but I think the most likely outcome is that he calls it quits at the end of next year.

Venus Williams is out of the top 150 with no signs of moving up. I think her career is basically done and she will retire very soon.

Serena Williams had chances to get her 24th Slam, but unfortunately Naomi Osaka was too good in Australia and Serena got injured at Wimbledon. This is a subjective opinion but the way she waved at everyone in Australia after her semifinals match made it seem like she knew her time was limited. I don't see her prolonging her career when she knows she can't be competitive anymore. I can see a farewell tour followed by a retirement next year.

It's been a great era, but it's coming to an end. I believe next year will be very significant with tennis icons dropping off one by one. I do think Djokovic will continue playing for a few years as he's still at the top and he still has the potential to win more Slams, but as we've seen in the US Open the NextGen are finally getting to a point where they can challenge him on the big stage. I think he'll retire in 2024 after making one more go at the Olympics, and the last remnants of the golden era will be gone.",1631824140
67,tennis,Is Djokovic not as well liked as Federer and Nadal because of stereotypes associated with the country he is from?,"https://www.eurosport.com/tennis/us-open/2021/it-s-not-acceptable-novak-djokovic-gets-unfair-treatment-compared-to-roger-federer-and-rafael-nadal-_sto8545236/story.shtml

Off the top of my head, these are some stereotypes Western people associate with Swiss,Spanish and Serbian people(based on different media):

Swiss: classy, elegant, neutral, politically correct, chocolate, skiing

Spanish: fun loving, dancing, stay up all night, partier,  bullfighting, 

Serbian:aggressive, fighter, villainous, sneaky, selfish.

To be clear, I don't agree with all of these stereotypes nor do I claim this to be the list of stereotypes. Dusan Lajovic seems to agree with at least one of my listed stereotypes. 
https://www.atptour.com/en/news/lajovic-atp-cup-q-and-a-2021

I just find it hard to believe that people don't understand why djokovic isn't as liked. His actions are viewed through the lens of Serbian stereotypes.

11,tennis,How many slams would each of the big 3 have if they weren't from the same era?,"Obviously this doesn't factor at all into the GOAT debate but it's fun to think about at the very least.

My thoughts:

Roger would have at least 30 and probably around 32, for years and years he'd only ever lose in the semis and final and it'd inevitably be to either Novak or Rafa. Especially at the French, he'd have a much healthier trophy count. Possibly his only significant loss that didn't come to these two was to del Potro at US'09.

Rafa would have around 27. While he'd have a maximum of 2 more RG, he's often fallen just a bit short of the other two in other finals, specifically at AO. But the fact that's he's a lot more shaky against the rest of the tour in the early rounds (especially at Wimbledon) means he probably wouldn't have much more than 27.

Novak would probably only have a maximum of 25. Especially in recent years, he's converted almost every single opportunity in majors against the other two. His losses at the biggest stage have often been to players from outside the big 3 (Murray, Wawrinka, Medvedev etc.)",1631780452

But Craig Tyzzer stressed the change-up did not cost his star charge the match against inspired American Shelby Rogers and that there were no excuses from Team Barty.

With player and coach finding the conditions at Flushing Meadows vastly different to where the Australian won her fifth title of the season in Cincinnati, Tyzzer opted to change the top seed‚Äôs racket strings before playing Rogers.

‚ÄúLook, it was super different conditions,‚Äù Tyzzer told AAP. ‚ÄúThe men use a different ball to the women at the US Open and the women‚Äôs ball is really light and it gets faster. All the stats show that most of the girls, when the ball got older, their actual shots got faster.

‚ÄúIt was super tough to control the ball and to keep it in the court and I actually, for her third-round match, took the gut out of her racket because she was struggling in the first two rounds to keep the ball in court.

‚ÄúI mean, she did a great job getting through. She literally could not get the ball up and down with any sort of spin. So we put full poly in her racket for her third-round match in the hope that she could just get a little bit more feel. It took a bit of weight off her serve, which is not ideal for her, just to give her that confidence in being able to hit off the ground and play.‚Äù

With Barty making a raft of unforced errors in dropping the opening set 6-2 to Rogers, the tinker may have affected the title favourite‚Äôs rhythm. But while he took full responsibility, Tyzzer said neither he nor Barty blamed the change for her defeat.

‚ÄúThe conditions suited players who are counter-punchers and stay up on the baseline and hit flat because the courts are dead but the ball is pretty lively and flies through the court,‚Äù Tyzzer said from quarantine in Melbourne. ‚ÄúBut in the end, it wasn‚Äôt down to that. She was just physically and mentally exhausted; completely done. She just didn‚Äôt have anything left in the tank, unfortunately.‚Äù

Asked if Barty was cranky at all with him, Tyzzer said: ‚ÄúLook, she probably could be but it was more that I just wanted to ease her mind about having feel and playing with the conditions. It wasn‚Äôt her decision ‚Äì it was my decision.

‚ÄúIn the end, I don‚Äôt think it cost her the match because she‚Äôd basically gone 6-1, 5-1 \[in the second and third sets\] playing the right way and just ran out of steam. I think the decision was right with the string because she was able to do more of the things that she wanted to do other than probably serve better.‚Äù

Tennis lessons is out of the question, he has a newborn and zero time. I'm aware Nadal has own merch shop but I wanted to get something more meaningful than clothes. He is also no artsy guy, so also no posters or drawings.

Is a signed item the only option? What else is there in terms of tennis gifts? Is there a reliable website/seller which I can be sure is selling real Nadal stuff?

I know Googling goes a long way, but I just need advice from someone with a clear idea. Another gift is off the table, he has been a Rafa fan ever since I remember him and I know he would never expect such a gift. Thanks a bunch.",1631738179

73,tennis,I‚Äôll probs get downvoted to hell ‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶..,"I‚Äôm genuinely getting Federer-esque vibes from Raducanu. I know she‚Äôs just won her first major but that US Open run was something else and there are far too many variables for it to be just ‚Äúluck ‚Äú like a lot of haters are already saying. You don‚Äôt win 10 rounds in a row without losing a set unless you‚Äôre sh1t hot. She‚Äôs multilingual, more marketable than probably all of the WTA combined with exception to Osaka, has a great image and I only see her getting stronger.
The only fear I have is that she does a Bouchard or something and just loses interest and starts modelling or fame gets to her head and she loses that humility. That‚Äôs why the big 3 I feel are just unique. They are able to play incredible tennis but also have the smarts to know what to say and what not to say but also remain passionate enough about their craft off the court to still be able to produce the goods when they get on it",1631732640

These two young people are special. As a Canadian, I've been following Leylah casually since last year, but she REALLY made herself known to me these past two weeks. I really wish her first serve was working this match, but it gives her something to improve on and I'm proud of the way she fought for every single point.

This isn't meant to argue particularly for one or the other, but it's interesting to see where they're similar and where one stands out from the other. Enjoy!

Main takeaways I had:

\- Djokovic is an absolute nightmare to beat in 5 sets

\- Federer's peak consistency in reaching finals was truly insane

\- Djokovic has won a lot more of his slams beating the Big Four than Federer has

\- Federer does not mess around when he's up against a player other than Nadal or Djokovic

\- Djokovic is much better at come-from-behind victories

\- Both have a losing head-to-head against Nadal in GS finals

Plus some nice stats about Murray I noticed:

\- Murray has beaten Djokovic in more GS finals than Federer has

\- Murray is the only player to beat Djokovic in a GS final in 5 sets

\- Murray is the only member of the Big Four with a perfect finals record against players who aren't the Big Four",1631718806

96,tennis,"Novak had in mind to finish his career, had he won the US Open.","I know that this will probably sound far-fetched, but bear with me. I was thinking about the way Sunday‚Äôs final played out, and I'm convinced that Novak had in mind to finish his career, had he won the US Open. Several clues point to that:

**The on-court interview.**  After beating Zverev in the semifinal, he said that he will play the final match like it was the last of his career. Quote: ""There is only one more match. All in, all in. Let's do it! I'm going to treat that match like it's the last match of my career."" At that time I thought, as everybody else did, that it was just a figure of speech. A bold statement, of a kind he likes to give. But, I ask you to read the quote again, after reading the rest of this text. 

**The final post-match press conference**, the part where he spoke to the Serbian journalists. Quote: ""Well you need to keep on getting better. Otherwise, stagnation, regression. Without training hard in all aspects, both on the court and outside of the court, you cannot have the results. And of course, the more time passes, for us older guys, it's getting harder. It's getting 2x harder for us than for the younger ones, to stay on the top, to be candidates for winning Slams. I am definitely aware of that, but it's not something that worries me, it's a natural cycle of life. But I don't feel old and worn out, in my body. Of course, now, life is also much different. I am also a husband, a father. When I look at my life as a whole, I have other priorities. I'd like to spend more time with my kids, I promised that to myself, because...  Being away from them hurts.  A lot.  I'm sorry."" Then, he started to cry, and left the press room in tears. When you think about what he said, it seems that he is tired, not physically, but tired emotionally, tired of scarifying family time, family life, for his tennis. Tennis is the only life he has known, since he was a child. Disciplined and devoted as he is, all these years he was ready to work and work harder, but at the price of not having the time for other stuff in his life. It's obvious that it is becoming increasingly hard for him, especially since he became a family man. It's not just the travel and being physically away from his family. It is also the hours he puts into training, each and every day. Even when he is close to them, he cannot spend enough time with them. He said he promised to himself that he would change that. And, I think, at some point during this year, this epic Slam run, an idea was born. To end it all while he's at the very top. If he was to win the USO, he would quit. With that win he would have achieved the CYGS, his record 21st Major, and his record 7th year-end number one. Those achievements would cement his position as the GOAT. And he would be free. Free from grueling everyday training and preparations. Free to live another life. Free to be with his kids as much as he wanted.

**The tears.** The way Novak cried before Medvedev's last service game that ended the set, and the match, was unprecedented. The scene was truly shocking. He looked to be in agony, in despair. And, I believe, that he was not crying over losing the USO. He had won so many Slams, and had some tough loses too. And the CYGS, I don‚Äôt think he cried because of that, either. He already had won all four in a row. He had that achievement no other male player of his, and many previous generations could get to.  Those were not tears of loss. Those were the tears of separation. From his family, from his children. From a new life he had imagined for himself.  That was the moment that he realized that the chase is not over. That the grind was not over. That the sacrifice was not over. 

Yes, I know, all of this sounds far-fetched. But, I think it's possible that, sometimes into the future, maybe in an interview or a biography, we will learn that there was some kind of plan to end it all there and then. But, life is tough, even for the most successful people, and life laughs at our plans. I'm sure that Novak will swallow this hard pill and will bounce back. He is a seasoned player gifted with exceptional resilience.
